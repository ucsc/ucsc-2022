SANTA CRUZ, CA--Nicole "Coco" Medvitz has been named as the recipient of  the 1996-97 Priscilla Newton Undergraduate Scholarship in Theater Arts,  given annually at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Medvitz, who has  appeared in numerous campus and community productions, is a UCSC senior  majoring in theater arts with a dual emphasis on drama and dance.

The scholarship program, now in its sixth year, was established to  support students who have shown outstanding talent and dedication to their  work in theater arts. The $3,000 scholarships are awarded on the basis of  merit and need, with preference given to women.

Medvitz, who shared the scholarship last year with another student, is  the first student to receive the scholarship a second time. "Coco has been an  active and valued member of the Theater Arts Department since she came to  campus," said theater arts chair Elaine Yokoyama Roos. "Her talent and her  dedication are outstanding and we are delighted to be able to provide her  with this deserved support."

Medvitz, who is currently performing in a UCSC production of Trojan  Women, said she values the scholarship both for the financial support it  provides and for the affirmation of the importance of women in theater. "I'm  proud to be awarded the scholarship, and I'm excited. It feels especially  significant because there is not a lot of support for women in this business.  The essence of the award--that it is intended specifically for women--is  encouraging because it recognizes the value of women in a field where they  do not traditionally receive a lot of support."

The scholarship fund was, in fact, established to honor a respected  Broadway actress. The late Bernard Oliver created the fund in 1991 in honor  of his wife, Priscilla Newton, who died in 1994. In the early years of her  career, Newton worked with such actresses as Ethel Barrymore and Helen  Hayes in Broadway productions that included Our Town, Farm of Three  Echoes, and My Sister Eileen. Her career continued on Broadway and in  Chicago until World War II when Newton joined the USO and entertained  troops in Alaska and elsewhere in the U.S. At war's end she married Bernard  Oliver, then an engineer with Bell Laboratories. Soon after their marriage  the couple moved to Palo Alto where Oliver became director of research for  Hewlett-Packard. As mother of two girls and a boy, Newton left the  professional stage but continued acting, playing major roles with the Palo  Alto Community Theater, Stanford University, Foothill College, and the Los  Altos Conservatory Theater. Newton died in 1994 at the age of 79. Bernard  Oliver died in 1995 at the age of 79.

Medvitz, who is currently in the process of applying to graduate  programs in theater arts, began acting as a freshman in high school. In her  last two years of high school and freshman year of college, Medvitz played  the role of Snow White at Disneyland. At UCSC she has performed as Blue,  the lead role in Beirut; Pegeen in Playboy of the Western World; Louka in  Arms and the Man; Lyse in The Illusion; and Prospero in Shakespeare To Go's  Tempest. She also starred as Sally Bowles in Cabaret, presented by Sisyphus  Repertory. This past year she performed in the campus's spring dance  production, played Lychorida in Shakespeare Santa Cruz's Pericles; Doreen in  the UCSC production of Tartuffe; and, currently, as Andromache in UCSC's  Trojan Women.
