SANTA CRUZ, CA--Charles Eadie will join the UC Santa Cruz Office of Physical Planning and Construction (PP&C), as director of Campus and Community Planning. Frank Zwart, associate vice chancellor for Physical Planning and Construction, made the announcement, noting "Charlie's knowledge of our campus and our community, and his commitment to the thoughtful and sustainable development of both, make him an extremely valuable addition to our staff. It's a delight to be able to welcome him back to UCSC."

On the job beginning today (May 10), Eadie will direct all physical and environmental planning for the UCSC campus and for several of the off-campus lands managed by UCSC. He will work closely with capital planning staff and PP&C's architects and engineers to coordinate capital planning, physical planning, design and construction activities. He will also work closely with UCSC's Housing, Dining, and Child Care Services on planning and development of all campus inclusion areas, and with University Relations to develop and maintain channels for communicating campus planning activities to both on-campus and off-campus constituencies.

Commenting on his appointment, Eadie said, "UC Santa Cruz is entering an exciting phase in its history, replete with great promise and significant planning challenges. I am looking forward to renewing my ties with the campus and the Santa Cruz community, while helping to expand the mutual benefits of the relationships between the university and its partners and prospective partners in the region."

In addition to his planning activities, Eadie will represent the university with local and regional agencies and citizen groups, work with local planning agencies on issues of joint concern, and work with neighboring communities in regard to off-campus and on-campus projects.

Eadie brings extensive planning experience in local government and as a consultant. He has been with the city of Watsonville for the past eight years, and was promoted to assistant director of community development in 1996. Prior to that he worked for the city of Santa Cruz where he had a major role in the recovery of the downtown following the Loma Prieta earthquake as the project manager for Vision Santa Cruz and the Downtown Recovery Plan.

Eadie has long been active as a community volunteer and currently is an officer of the Pajaro Valley Performing Arts Association. Previously, he was president of the Cultural Council of Santa Cruz County, was a long-time volunteer with KUSP, and has coached several Little League teams. His education includes a B.A. from UC Santa Cruz in environmental planning (1974 with honors), a master's degree in journalism from UC Berkeley (1981), and the completion of Ph.D. course work in public administration from the University of Texas in 1986 where he was a member of the Phi Kappa Phi honors society. Eadie lives in Santa Cruz with his wife and four children.

Recognizing that there will be challenges associated with his new position, Eadie commented, "I hope that the intensity of feelings held by many about university growth issues will serve to sustain the effort and commitment needed to work through the details. I will make every effort to help find collaborative solutions to the planning challenges on and off campus."
