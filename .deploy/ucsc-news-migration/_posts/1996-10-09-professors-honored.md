SANTA CRUZ, CA--Four professors in the Division of Social Sciences at the  University of California, Santa Cruz, were honored today (Wednesday,  October 9) for their excellence in teaching.

The recipients of the Division of Social Sciences 1996 Distinguished  Teaching Awards are:

* **John Borrego**, associate professor of community studies
* **Mark Harmon**, assistant professor of politics
* **Avril Thorne**, associate professor of psychology
* **Carl Walsh**, professor of economics

The award, which recognizes outstanding undergraduate teaching in the  social sciences, carries with it a $500 cash prize and an engraved plaque  that features a "golden apple."

Social Sciences Dean Martin Chemers announced the recipients at the  annual division convocation this morning. Recipients were selected by  Chemers from a list of nominees compiled by department chairs. The annual  awards were established in 1991 by former dean Eugene Garcia.

"UC Santa Cruz is well-known for its emphasis on undergraduate  education, and it's due in large part to the dedication and talent of faculty  like these," said Chemers. "I can't thank them enough for their fine work, and  I'm happy to celebrate with them today."

Social sciences is one of four academic divisions at UCSC; the others  are arts, humanities, and natural sciences. Each division is home to a wide  range of departments and programs. Social sciences includes anthropology,  community studies, economics, education, environmental studies, Latin  American and Latino studies, politics, psychology, and sociology.
