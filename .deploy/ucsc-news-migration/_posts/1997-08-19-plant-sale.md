SANTA CRUZ, CA--Gardeners, don't take off those gloves! Don't hang up your  spades! Instead, get ready for the second annual Fall Plant Sale at UC Santa  Cruz on Friday and Saturday, September 5 and 6. Hours are noon to 6 P.M. on  Friday and 10 A.M. to 2 P.M. on Saturday. The sale will take place in the Barn  Theater parking lot at the intersection of Bay and High Streets at the base of  campus.

Fall is a perfect time to garden on the Central Coast. Warm soil, mild  weather, and relatively long days provide optimal conditions for planting  perennials and winter vegetables. The sale will feature some of the UC Santa  Cruz Farm and Garden's best-sellers, including lavenders, penstemon,  yarrow, ornamental oregano, roses, subtropical salvias, ornamental grasses,  and lamb's ear. A broad range of vegetables will also be available in six- packs, including broccoli, peas, Asian greens, salad mix, leeks, scallions,  head lettuce, kale, and chard. All plants are organically grown.

Experienced gardeners know that a little effort in autumn pays off in  the spring. By providing a few waterings until the rains come, gardeners can  give their new plants a great start on spring. Fall planting gives perennials a  chance to become established and acclimated so they'll be ready to take off  when the weather dictates.

Fall plantings can also dramatically extend the harvest period of some  vegetables, including lettuce. Instead of the typical two- or three-week  harvest period that mature lettuce offers in the summer, plants that go in  the ground in the fall will produce for two to three months during the  winter.

Sponsored by the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food  Systems, the sale will benefit the UCSC Apprenticeship in Ecological  Horticulture. Members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden will receive  a 10 percent discount on purchases; memberships will be available at the  sale. For more information about the Fall Plant Sale or the Friends of the  Farm & Garden, call 459-3240.
