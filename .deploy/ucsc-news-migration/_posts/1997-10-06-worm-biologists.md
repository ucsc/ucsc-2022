**Two Young Researchers Set Up Labs To Study C. Elegans, One Of Biology's Key Model Organisms**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Worms are turning by the thousands in a pair of  labs at the UC Santa Cruz Biology Department. But these are not  earthworms, and the work is no fishing expedition. Rather,  scientists Andrew Chisholm and Yishi Jin are conducting forefront  research on the hidden world of C. elegans, a minuscule nematode  that is teaching us volumes about how life unfolds.

The transparent worm, one millimeter long, looks uninspiring  in your hand or a petri dish. But under a microscope it's serpentine  and graceful, various cells glowing under the influence of a  biologist's stains. It's simple enough to consist of just 959 cells as  an adult, yet complex enough that we can see many crucial human  developmental processes mirrored in its three-day life cycle.

Biologists in about 200 labs around the world explore the many  puzzles posed by C. elegans. How do specialized cells, such as  neurons and muscles, arise from the fertilized egg? How do these  cells know which of their genes to "turn on," and when? What  happens as the cells age, and what determines when they die?

Targeted inquiries within those areas gradually help biologists  assemble each puzzle, piece by piece. For instance, Chisholm focuses  on how the worm's skin forms while it is an embryo, and how this  sheath of cells encompasses the rest of the organism. The work  promises to shed light on cell-cell communication, metastasis, and  certain genes that may contribute to cancer. Jin probes the  development of synapses--junctions among neurons that allow the  nervous system to function. This poorly understood process affords  neurobiologists a glimpse of the abilities of nerves to regenerate  and reconnect, rather than becoming hard-wired at birth.

In the close-knit C. elegans research community, these studies  have marked Chisholm and Jin as rising talents. They already have  earned impressive laurels since joining UCSC's faculty 18 months  ago. Both won grants for about $200,000 per year from the National  Institutes of Health in the most competitive "R01" category. And the  Alfred P. Sloan Foundation recognized their potential with  prestigious fellowships worth $35,000 annually for two years.

Indeed, Chisholm and Jin are thriving during this hectic time of  launching their labs, teaching classes, writing grant proposals,  working toward tenure, and the other challenges of being assistant  professors. Added to that, now, is a new son: Julian, born August 26.  Chisholm and Jin are married, having met as postdoctoral  researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

When the pace becomes overwhelming, it's a good bet to look  for either of these researchers not in their offices but at a  microscope, studying their worms.

"For me, they are mind-settling," says Jin. "If I'm angry or  under stress, they help me relax. They are such a part of my life."

Chisholm regards C. elegans as "old friends, but they definitely  hold surprises for you. To someone who has never looked at them,  they're boring. But under a nice microscope, they are very beautiful,  clean, and precise."

Within the next few months, biologists at other institutions  will finish a monumental effort to spell out the worm's entire  genetic code, comprising some 100 million "letters," or fundamental  units of DNA. C. elegans will be the first multicellular organism  with a fully sequenced genome; the human genome, some 30 times  larger, won't be finished until the middle of the next decade.

With the genome in hand, biologists no longer will need to  embark on the "nightmarish saga," in Chisholm's words, of hunting  and pecking for genes of interest. All of the C. elegans genes, more  than 15,000 of them, will be exposed, waiting for enterprising  scientists to scrutinize their functions.

It's fascinating, the researchers say, to note the similarity  between many of the worm's genes and our own, especially among  genes whose functions are essential to life. That's why C. elegans  and biology's other model organisms--yeast, fruit fly, mouse--are  so valuable to fleshing out our understanding of human  developmental biology and diseases.

C. elegans has proven most useful for yielding a complete  descriptive anatomy of a complex organism, from egg to 959-cell  adult. Scientists understand the fates of each of those cells. Teasing  apart the genetic controls that dictate such fates--the "pathways"  of genes involved in each process, as Jin says--is considerably more  challenging.

As postdoctoral researchers, Jin and Chisholm each published  C. elegans papers in Nature, one of the world's leading scientific  journals. Their studies at UCSC are still too nascent to have resulted  in such publications--but don't be surprised, their colleagues say, to  see them ascend rapidly to the field's top tier.

The two biologists restore a Santa Cruz-C. elegans connection  fostered for many years by professor emeritus of biology Robert  Edgar, who retired in 1991. One of the discipline's notable  scientists, Edgar launched in 1975 the Worm Breeder's Gazette, a  publication in which worm biologists unhesitatingly share their  latest data and techniques. The cover art of each edition features  worms, naturally, in various playful guises.
