SANTA CRUZ, CA--In a gift valued at more than $90,000, Sun Microsystems  Computer Company has donated 10 workstations and related equipment to  the University of California, Santa Cruz. The gift will enable UCSC to greatly  expand its capabilities in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology  and is the linchpin of a lab expansion that will more than double the size of  the campus's existing GIS facility.

"We launched our GIS lab three years ago in part through the generosity  of Sun Microsystems and are delighted to be able to build on the success of  that facility with this new gift," said Marc Mangel, director of the GIS  Laboratory and a professor of environmental studies at UCSC.

GIS technology facilitates the analysis of spatial questions and  problems by allowing users to visualize alternatives through a powerful set  of tools that manipulate and display multiple geographic datasets. GIS is  becoming a widely used tool in a range of fields, including engineering,  planning, ecology, and marketing. At UCSC, the technology is being used by a  number of professors in ongoing projects on subjects as diverse as  monitoring of oceanographic conditions, researching open-space  preservation patterns in California, and studying wildlife habitat and  coastal erosion rates.

UCSC's new Applied GIS Laboratory will house the workstations,  providing space for 10 students to work on individual computers with access  to GIS and other advanced technologies.

"It is important to make this new technology available to students so  they can use it in their classes, projects, and theses," said Mangel. "These  students will graduate with a useful skill that will not only facilitate their  entry into the job market but will also enhance their careers over the long  run."
