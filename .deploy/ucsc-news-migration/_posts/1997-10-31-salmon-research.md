SANTA CRUZ, CA--The number of Atlantic salmon in American rivers has  dropped dramatically in recent years, making the scientific quest to  understand the mysteries of the life cycle of the remaining fish a high  priority.

One of the scientists at the forefront of that investigation is Marc  Mangel, a professor of environmental studies at the University of California,  Santa Cruz. Mangel is a key member of the small international community of  researchers dedicated to probing the biological and environmental factors  that trigger the salmon's patterns of migration and spawning.

To further the probe, Mangel recently started a three-year project,  funded by the National Marine Fisheries Service, to explore how oceanic  conditions affect patterns of maturation, migration, and survival of the  Atlantic salmon.

"Atlantic salmon used to be all over New England, but now they're  largely absent from American rivers because of overfishing, habitat  destruction, and pollution," said Mangel. "In North America, now they're found  only in Maine and Canada."

Ultimately, understanding the life cycle will enable fishery scientists  to predict abundance, which is critical information when regulators set  harvest quotas. "This research has great applied value," said Mangel.  "Aquaculturists need to understand how individual fish grow and interact  with environmental conditions to make accurate predictions."

Atlantic salmon, which measure between 18 and 36 inches at  adulthood, are born in freshwater, migrate to sea, and return to freshwater  to reproduce. Unlike Pacific salmon, many Atlantic salmon survive to spawn  again. Although juvenile Atlantic salmon in North America typically first  head to sea at the age of two or three years, migration may occur as late as  the age of eight, depending on the latitude of the river, and Mangel and his  colleagues want to understand what determines the age of this important  migration.

Mangel will be working with scientists at the Northeast Fisheries  Science Center in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, which is the regional research  arm of the National Marine Fisheries Service. His first task will be to  analyze data collected by his colleagues on the survival of salmon at sea  relative to their growth rate.

"Using their data, I'll be able to make inferences about growth rate and  how it affects return of salmon to the rivers," said Mangel. "Generally, the  bigger a fish is, the higher its chances of surviving, but there are trade- offs." For example, fast growth may suppress the immune system as the  fish's energy is directed toward building tissue. Speedy growth may also  indicate that the fish has enjoyed a large food supply, which may carry the  increased risk of a correspondingly large population of predators. Finally,  ocean temperatures affect growth rates, too.

Mangel will spend the second phase of the project developing  mathematical models of individual fish growth that incorporate all three  variables: growth, risk, and environmental conditions.

The work has value for aquaculture companies because the  physiological changes associated with reproduction are linked to the quality  of the product. For example, maturing Atlantic salmon stop eating around  July in anticipation of returning to freshwater and reproducing in November.  Members of the aquaculture industry are eager to know how to determine  which fish are preparing to reproduce.

Mangel's previous research has revealed details of the Atlantic  salmon's life cycle: Born in April, the fish's first opportunity to head out to  sea comes 13 months later in May; subsequent opportunities occur every 12  months. Because bigger fish are more likely to survive the journey and  prosper at sea, Mangel wanted to understand the mechanisms by which the  fish "decide" when to migrate. Through a series of experiments and models,  he has found that August is the critical time when salmon essentially "ask  themselves if they'll be ready next May or not," factoring in the anticipated  decline in food supply that comes with winter.

"If the answer is yes, it triggers physiological processes that help  prepare the fish for departure in May," said Mangel. "If the answer is no, they  prepare to stay over again by eating a lot through September and then  slowing their metabolism so they'll be able to run on their reserves as they  hide through most of the winter."

Mangel's new collaboration with the National Marine Fisheries Service,  which has provided $45,000 for the first year of the project, will add  further detail to the picture of the Atlantic salmon's life cycle.
