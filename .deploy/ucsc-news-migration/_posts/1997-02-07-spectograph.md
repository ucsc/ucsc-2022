title: Multi-Object Spectrograph Helps Keep Lick Observatory At Forefront

SANTA CRUZ, CA--A miniature forest of robotically controlled  optical fibers has sprouted from the end of the 120-inch Shane  Telescope at Lick Observatory near San Jose, letting astronomers  capture and analyze faint rays of light from dozens of distant stars  or galaxies at the same time.

Named the multi-object spectrograph (MOS), the device is the  fruit of a collaboration between researchers at the University of  California, Santa Cruz, which operates Lick Observatory, and  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). After more than a  decade of design, manufacture, tests, and refinements, MOS became  available for routine use last fall.

Principal designer Jean Brodie, associate professor of  astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, says MOS has expanded  the research horizon at Lick Observatory for three main reasons:

* Speed. MOS shuffles its slender quartz fibers into  preprogrammed positions in five minutes. Similar fiber-optic  spectrographs elsewhere take as long as half an hour to move from  one set of targets on the sky to the next, sacrificing valuable  observing time.
* Accuracy. MOS places the fibers to within a tolerance of just  10 microns (one-hundredth of a millimeter). That translates to about  one-tenth of an arcsecond on the sky--an angular measure so precise  that atmospheric blurring is a far larger worry than the alignment of  the fibers.
* Field of view. MOS's wide-angle vision encompasses one  square degree, a chunk of sky some five times larger than the full  moon. Special corrective lenses create a flat, undistorted image.

These attributes, says Brodie, make MOS unique in the world.  "MOS is fast, accurate, and efficient," she says. "It offers all kinds  of observational flexibility. This system doesn't try to compete with  10-meter class telescopes, but it is a perfect complement to them  because it is optimized to perform entirely different kinds of  science."

For instance, MOS is ideal for surveying the properties of large  numbers of scattered objects, such as stars in swarms called  globular clusters or groups of galaxies. It's not as efficient to use  larger telescopes to study many such objects, says Brodie, because  the telescopes cover tiny patches of sky--75 times smaller in the  case of the W. M. Keck Telescopes. Further, a multi-object  spectrograph dramatically cuts the prohibitive time it takes to  observe numerous objects individually.

Brodie and her MOS collaborators plan to use the instrument to  study clusters of galaxies that emit x-rays, stars in "open clusters,"  regions in the Milky Way where stars form, supernova remnants, and  globular clusters around our sister galaxy, M31, in Andromeda. The  latter study promises to shed light on the structure, evolution, and  chemical history of this grand spiral galaxy.

Another UC Santa Cruz astronomer, Puragra Guhathakurta, used  MOS in September to probe distant galaxies that existed at a time  when the universe was about two-thirds of its current age.  Guhathakurta's team measured how quickly the galaxies rotate and  examined how their brightnesses may have evolved over time. "MOS  performed beautifully and exceeded our expectations in several  cases," he says.

Astrophysicists Charles Hailey and William Craig, both now at  Columbia University, are Brodie's primary collaborators on MOS. They  oversaw an engineering team at LLNL that designed the fiber-optic  positioning system and rebuilt an off-the-shelf robot to deploy the  fibers.

The guts of MOS are a tribute to precision machining. Each  fiber, about two-tenths of a millimeter wide, is housed in a three- millimeter button. The buttons each contain a prism the size of a  grain of sand to direct light from the telescope into the top of the  fiber. The buttons also hold tiny magnets to secure them to the  surface of the instrument's metal plate.

To observe with MOS, astronomers prepare a list of precise  coordinates on the sky for the objects they wish to study. A  computer decides how to place the fibers most efficiently so that  none of them tangle or collide. Then, a robotic arm darts into the  optical spaghetti to rearrange it into the correct pattern. MOS  currently has about 60 fibers, with another 40 on the way. Future  plans call for upgrading the instrument to 250 fibers.

The fibers run down the side of the school-bus-sized telescope  in a bundle some 130 feet long, then into a stationary spectrograph  on the floor of the telescope dome. The spectrograph spreads the  light rays into their component colors, or "spectra," for analysis. The  Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope donated the spectrograph to Lick  Observatory in the 1980s; a future spectrograph planned for MOS  would further increase its efficiency by a factor of five.

Engineers, opticians, and technicians at the UCO/Lick  Observatory shops at UC Santa Cruz built the optical systems-- designed by Professor Harland Epps--and electronics for MOS, as  well as the "top end" structure that holds it at the telescope's prime  focus. Other key members of the team that helped put the system in  place at the 120-inch telescope are LLNL chief technician Steve  Andrews and astronomer Ron Wurtz, UCO/Lick engineers David  Cowley, Eric James, and Matt Radovan, Lick Observatory specialist  Anthony Misch, current UCSC graduate student Kathleen Flint, and  former UCSC graduate student Hank Donnelly.
