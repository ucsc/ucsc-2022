SANTA CRUZ, CA--If your apple tree is looking anemic, or your peaches have  lost their punch, you'll want to attend a two-day fruit-tree workshop for the  home gardener at UC Santa Cruz on February 7 and 8.

Orin Martin, manager of the Alan Chadwick Garden at UCSC, will offer  tips for beginning gardeners and those who want to improve their skills. The  emphasis will be on dwarf fruit trees, especially apples and pears, and he'll  cover everything from rootstock and variety selection to planting, pruning,  training, harvesting, and basic care.

"The timing of this workshop will help both gardeners who have trees  that need pruning and those who are gearing up to plant trees," says Martin.  "By planting dwarf trees, home gardeners can get more varieties in a limited  space, and they can prune without high ladders. With smaller trees, the home  orchardist can select varieties that will produce apples for nearly year- round production." Dwarf trees, which reach heights of six to ten feet when  mature, also require "less pruning and more training," adds Martin.

The workshop begins Friday evening from 7 to 9 P.M. with a slide show,  lecture, and question-and-answer session in the Horticulture Building at the  UCSC Arboretum. It continues Saturday from 9 A.M. to 1 P.M. with a  demonstration in the Chadwick Garden of planting, pruning, and training that  will be followed by an opportunity for hands-on experience under the  supervision of Martin and other staff.

The cost of the workshop is $50, or $40 for members of the Friends of  the Farm and Garden or Monterey Bay Master Gardeners. Enrollment is  limited, and the registration deadline is January 31. To register by phone,  call (408) 459-3240 or (408) 459-3376. To register by mail, send a check  payable to the UC Regents to CASFS, University of California, 1156 High  Street, Santa Cruz, CA 95064-1077, Attn: Pruning Workshop.
