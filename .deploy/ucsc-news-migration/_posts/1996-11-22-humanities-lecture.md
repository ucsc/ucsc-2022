author: Barbara McKenna

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Judy Yung, associate professor of American  studies at UC Santa Cruz, is the featured speaker in this month's  Humanities Lecture Series, presented jointly by UCSC's Humanities  Division and the Museum of Art and History. Yung's talk, "Unbound  Feet: Reclaiming Chinese American Women's History," takes place  from 7 to 8 p.m. on Thursday, December 12, at the Museum of Art and  History at the McPherson Center, 705 Front St., Santa Cruz. The talk  is free and open to the public. A reception follows.

Yung's talk, which will include slides, is based on her award-winning book, Unbound Feet: A Social History of Chinese  Women in San Francisco (University of California Press, 1995). Yung  uses foot-binding as a central theme in her book to trace the stages  of "unbinding" that took place in the lives of Chinese immigrant  women in San Francisco from the late 1800s through the end of  World War II.

San Francisco was home to nearly 50 percent of all Chinese  women in the U.S. at the turn of the century. Yung presents an  engaging history of these women by supplementing factual  information with case studies, profiles, and oral histories of  immigrant and American-born women who lived in those times. Her  facts were meticulously researched using U.S. census and  immigration documents, Chinese- and English-language newspapers,  and oral history.

The book recently received the 1996 National Book Award in  History from the Association of Asian American Studies and the  Robert C. Athearn Award from the Western History Association.

Yung is also the author of Chinese Women of America: A  Pictorial History (University of Washington Press, 1986) and, with  Him Mark Lai and Genny Lim, Island: Poetry and History of Chinese  Immigrants on Angel Island, 1910-1940 (University of Washington  Press, 1991), winner of the 1982 Before Columbus Foundation Book  Award.
