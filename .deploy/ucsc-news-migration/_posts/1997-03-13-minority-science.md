title: UCSC Receives Renewed Funding For Minority Science Support Program

SANTA CRUZ, CA--The National Science Foundation (NSF) has  renewed its support of a University of California effort to increase  the number of science degrees awarded to underrepresented minority  students. Called the California Alliance for Minority Participation  (CAMP), the initiative has drawn $1 million per year from NSF since  its inception in 1992. Now, NSF has committed to the same annual  level of funding for five more years.

As one of eight regional centers for the project, UC Santa Cruz  will receive $75,000 of the federal funds to continue its own CAMP  programs in 1997. A further pledge of $25,000 from the UC Regents'  Diversity Initiative fund will give the campus $100,000 for its  innovative CAMP activities.

"CAMP is one of the country's most successful alliances for  minority participation in the sciences," said associate professor of  chemistry and biochemistry Glenn Millhauser, the program's regional  director at UCSC. "We have come up with several uses of CAMP  funding at UCSC that we feel have helped our students succeed in  their science educations."

Those uses are as follows:
* Summer research stipends for students, allowing them to  work in the laboratories of UCSC scientists without worrying about  earning wages off campus. Between 10 and 20 CAMP participants,  mostly current students or incoming transfer students, work with  researchers in biology, chemistry, computer science, earth sciences,  physics, and other disciplines.
* Stipends for successful students in the ACE (ACademic  Excellence) program to return as tutors in science and mathematics  classes. ACE, funded by the Chancellor's Office and the Natural  Sciences Division, provides extra discussion groups and tutoring for  minority science students. Sponsoring the best of these students as  tutors, said Millhauser, is a CAMP effort unique to UCSC. "One of the  best ways to learn something is to teach it yourself," he said. "It  really cements a student's knowledge in that discipline."
* A collaborative effort with MESA (Mathematics,  Engineering, Science Achievement), primarily at Cabrillo College, to  bring community college students and their instructors to UCSC in  the summer for faculty seminars, science field trips, library and  computer instruction, and other activities. Each student receives a  stipend to defray the cost of being away from other jobs. "We find  that these programs really lower the fear that many minority  science students have about transferring to a four-year university,"  Millhauser said. "The feedback from students and their instructors  has been fabulous."
* Funds to send advanced CAMP students to conferences,  where they present talks or posters about their research. This  exposure allows students to see how scientific meetings work and  to make connections with scientists and students at other  institutions.

Headquartered at UC Irvine, CAMP funds the participation of  about 2,000 students each year. The CAMP regional centers, based at  the eight general-education UC campuses, share the goal of doubling  the number of California minority students with degrees in science  and engineering. Recent statistics show that those numbers are  indeed rising. For instance, the number of minority science  graduates from the University of California rose from 573 in 1989- 90 to 896 in 1994-95. At UCSC, the numbers increased from 42 to  89 in those same years.

However, Millhauser said, it's impossible to isolate the  possible effects of CAMP from many other ongoing campus efforts.  Those programs, many of which have existed for more than a decade,  include ACE, Minority Access to Research Careers (MARC) and  Minority Biomedical Research Support (MBRS), Minority International  Research Training (MIRT), special initiatives sponsored by the  Computer Engineering and Chemistry and Biochemistry Departments,  and other activities offered through UCSC's Educational Opportunity  Programs Office.
