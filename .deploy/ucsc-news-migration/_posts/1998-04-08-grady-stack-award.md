SANTA CRUZ, CA­ The American Chemical Society (ACS) has awarded the  1998 James T. Grady-James H. Stack Award for interpreting chemistry for  the public to Joseph W. Palca, who earned M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in  psychology from UC Santa Cruz in 1980 and 1982, respectively. Palca, a  science correspondent for National Public Radio (NPR) since 1992, is the  only radio reporter to receive the Grady-Stack Award since it was first  presented in 1957.

Palca's reports on NPR's Morning Edition, All Things Considered and  other shows cover a wide range of science topics. The ACS specifically  recognized his reporting on four stories with a heavy chemistry content,  including one on the chemistry of champagne and another on the  stereochemistry of the DNA molecule.

The Grady-Stack Award, which consists of $3,000 and a medal,  recognizes outstanding reporting that increases public knowledge and  understanding of chemistry, chemical engineering, and related fields. The  award was presented to Palca at the national meeting of the ACS in Dallas  on March 31.
