SANTA CRUZ, CA--The UCSC Arboretum and the Santa Cruz County  Chapter of the California Native Plant Society will host their annual  Spring Plant Sales on Saturday, April 19. The sales will run from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. in the Arboretum's eucalyptus grove, at the  intersection of High Street and Western Drive. The events are free  and open to the public.

Visitors can choose from more than 200 kinds of drought- resistant and colorful plants from California, Australia, and South  Africa, many of which attract hummingbirds. The Arboretum, as part  of its program to introduce new plants to the horticultural  community, will offer Swan River Pea (Brachysema celsianum), a  silver-leaved Australian shrub with dark red flowers that grows  well under eucalyptus trees. The sale will also feature several  species of Banksia and Protea, plants prized for their exotic flowers  and foliage.

Grey, president of the Santa Cruz County Chapter of the  California Native Plant Society, will lead a tour of the Arboretum's  Native Plant garden at 12 noon. The tour meets at Norrie's gift shop  in the Arboretum.

A special sale will be held for members of the Arboretum  Associates from 10 to 11 a.m. People wishing to join the Arboretum  Associates may purchase memberships at the festival.

The Arboretum gift shop, Norrie's, will be open throughout the  day, selling locally made wreaths of dried flowers, hummingbird T-shirts, books, and other gifts for the garden lover.

For more information about the plant sales, call the UCSC  Arboretum at (408) 427-2998.
