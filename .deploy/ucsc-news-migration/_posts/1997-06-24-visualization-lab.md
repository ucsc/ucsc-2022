SANTA CRUZ, CA--Scientists at the University of California, Santa  Cruz, soon will create powerful and informative graphical images  from their data at a new interdisciplinary laboratory, thanks to a  $460,000 equipment grant from the National Science Foundation  (NSF).

The Division of Natural Sciences at UCSC will match the  federal grant with about $240,000 in funding and equipment, making  the new lab worth about $700,000.

Once researchers establish the lab in the Applied Sciences  Building this fall, campus scientists in a wide variety of disciplines  will for the first time have access to a central facility for cutting- edge visualization.

"This grant enables us to put together a state-of-the-art  visualization facility that wouldn't otherwise be possible," said  project director Jane Wilhelms, associate professor of computer  science and an expert in computer graphics. "It will be a wonderful  resource for our scientists who already use scientific visualization.  I expect that many others at UCSC will begin to use visualization in  their research as well."

Today's complex scientific research makes visualization an  essential tool, Wilhelms said. This especially is true for researchers  who explore variations over a complex surface or within a volume of  space. Large sets of numbers, in and of themselves, can reveal some  useful knowledge. But when a scientist sees the data--with help  from colors, shading, vectors, and other visual aids--crucial  insights often emerge much more strikingly.

Eleven faculty members joined Wilhelms on UCSC's proposal to  NSF, representing seven diverse disciplines: astronomy and  astrophysics, chemistry and biochemistry, computer science,  computer engineering, earth sciences, ocean sciences, and physics.  Researchers from the Natural Sciences Division's other programs-- biology, mathematics, and science communication--also will use the  facility, she said. Students working on research projects with  faculty in the division will have opportunities to learn how to use  the lab and incorporate it into their research.

The grant and the campus matching funds will pay for an  advanced multiprocessor graphics workstation and supporting  hardware, worth several hundred thousand dollars. This system  likely will be the most powerful and expensive computer system on  campus, Wilhelms said.

Also planned is an array of audiovisual equipment, such as film  recorders and video editors, color printers, and equipment for  viewing three-dimensional graphics images. The latter may include a  "virtual workbench," a large table onto which researchers may  project 3-D data for viewing with stereo glasses. Similar facilities  now exist at Stanford University and the NASA Ames Research  Center in Mountain View.

Finally, the funds will pay part of the salary of a staff  technician to manage the lab and help researchers use it.

Work planned at the new lab by various UCSC researchers  includes the following:
* Wilhelms and colleague Allen Van Gelder, associate  professor of computer science, will continue to develop new  methods to visualize large and complex sets of data. Applications  for their software include materials engineering, simulations of  fluid flow and the dynamics of molecules, and analysis of data from  medical, atmospheric, and oceanographic instruments.
* Patrick Mantey, dean designate of the Jack Baskin School of  Engineering, and assistant professor of computer science Alex Pang  will extend the visualization component of a five-year research  program, called REINAS, that focuses on environmental data from the  Monterey Bay Area. Pang, a graphics expert, and his collaborators  have devised several new ways to image data from the ocean and  atmosphere in real time.
* Professor of physics Joel Primack, who initiated and helped  to organize UCSC's successful grant application, will use the new  equipment for research in cosmology. Currently, Primack's group  must use computers at other facilities to create dramatic  visualizations of theoretical models of how large-scale structure in  the universe has evolved.

"It will be far better to be able to interact visually with the  output from our supercomputer simulations here at UCSC, rather  than remotely," Primack said.

* Astronomers Sandra Faber and David Koo will translate  their observations of distant galaxies into rich visual displays.  Faber and Koo are part of a team at UCSC that will use the Hubble  Space Telescope and the large twin telescopes at the W. M. Keck  Observatory in Hawaii to gather data on thousands of distant  galaxies. The lab will help them simulate the histories of galaxies  and study their distribution in space.

Other key users will include assistant professor of computer  science Suresh Lodha, who will devise new methods of visualizing  shapes and uncertainties in scientific data; professor of physics  Stanley Flatte, for studies of how waves move through the ocean,  atmosphere, and earth; associate professor of chemistry Ilan  Benjamin, for simulations of chemical reactions that occur at the  boundaries between two substances; professor of earth sciences  Thorne Lay, for 3-D modeling of geological structures within the  planet; and professor of ocean sciences Geoffrey Vallis, for research  on turbulence and other complex behaviors in the ocean and  atmosphere.
