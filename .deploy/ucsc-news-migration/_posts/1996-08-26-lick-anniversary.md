MOUNT HAMILTON, CA--Of all the legacies of the eccentric  businessman and land baron James Lick, born August 25, 1796, none  has endured like the observatory near San Jose that bears his name.  If Lick had heard Sunday's celebration from his crypt beneath the  observatory's original telescope, he would have been pleased to learn  how his bequest has expanded our knowledge of the universe--even  if the buildings aren't as grand as the colossal statues and pyramid  he had envisioned as monuments to himself in downtown San  Francisco.

Friends of the Lick Observatory marked the 200th anniversary  of Lick's birth on August 25 with a special edition of "Music of the  Spheres," a summer concert series on Mount Hamilton. Lick's great- grandniece, Paquita Lick Machris, commissioned a bronze bust of  Lick for the occasion. Observatory personnel unveiled the bust and a  new plaque describing Lick's achievements and philanthropic deeds.

Proceeds will help finance renovations inside the historic  dome enclosing the Lick 36-inch telescope, which first cast its eye  on the sky in 1888. Architects have designed new railings and exits  to bring the structure in line with current safety codes.

The event featured music by the Smith and Gail Dobson Quartet  and a science lecture by observatory director Joseph Miller of UC  Santa Cruz, which operates Lick Observatory. Past director Donald  Osterbrock of UCSC and Dorothy Schaumberg, curator of the  observatory's Mary Lea Shane Archives at UCSC's McHenry Library,  gave historical talks.

Schaumberg focused much of her talk on James Lick himself.  As Lick neared the end of his life in the 1870s, scientists convinced  him that an observatory housing the world's largest telescope would  perpetuate his name through science, much as the Smithsonian  Institution had for James Smithson. They also assured him that  building the facility on top of a mountain, which astronomers had  never done, would lead to stunning results.

Lick chose Mount Hamilton over sites in the Sierra Nevada and  near Napa Valley. Although he could see Mount Hamilton from his  Santa Clara Valley property, he didn't journey to the summit until  his reinterment there in 1887, more than ten years after his death.

Schaumberg also described the pivotal roles of two men,  Richard Floyd and Thomas Fraser, in building Lick Observatory. "If  ever there was an odd couple to build the observatory, it was those  two," Schaumberg says. Floyd, president of Lick's Deed of Trust, was  an officer for the Confederate Navy during the Civil War; Fraser was  Lick's longtime foreman, an uneducated but exacting man who pushed  the Herculean project to completion as superintendent of  construction.

Osterbrock reviewed three of the many noteworthy  contributions to astronomy from Lick Observatory's history. His  vignettes, based on work at different telescopes and in different  eras, were as follows:
* The research of James Keeler, the observatory's second  director, at the Crossley 36-inch reflecting telescope in the 1890s.  Unlike the original Lick refractor, which uses a heavy lens of glass  to focus light at the end of an immense tube, the Crossley reflector  uses mirrors to focus light more compactly and with no distortion in  color. "Reflectors were tagged as 'amateur' telescopes, but that was  a misconception," Osterbrock says. "Keeler recognized that  reflectors were better for photography." He convinced other  astronomers with his stunning photographs of spiral nebulae--later  recognized as entire galaxies of stars.
* A sweeping effort under W. W. Campbell to measure the  velocities of stars. Campbell was the longest-serving director at  Lick, from 1901 to 1930; he also served for his last seven years as  president of the University of California. He optimized the Lick  refractor for measuring the speeds at which stars approach or  recede from earth--their "radial velocities." The massive program  lasted until World War II. "Lick became a factory for measuring  radial velocities," Osterbrock says. "All of this laid the groundwork  for our understanding of how stars evolve."
* The current efforts at Lick's main research instrument, the  120-inch Shane Telescope, to detect planets outside our solar  system. This work, which has made headlines worldwide, was done  and is being continued by Geoffrey Marcy and Paul Butler of San  Francisco State University and UC Berkeley. Marcy, who earned his  Ph.D. at UCSC, uses an exquisitely sensitive tool designed by his  former adviser, UCSC astronomer Steven Vogt. The instrument,  called the Hamilton Spectrograph, unveils tiny "wobbles" in the  motions of stars across the sky--hints of the gravitational tuggings  of unseen planets. Marcy and Butler have thus far announced six  planets spotted in this way.

Miller focused on current astronomy in his talk, "The Violent  Universe: Quasars, Blazars, and Galaxies in Collision." Miller directs  the UC Observatories/Lick Observatory, which oversees both Lick  Observatory and the University of California share of the W. M. Keck  Observatory in Hawaii, home to the world's largest optical  telescopes. The California Institute of Technology divides Keck  equally with UC.
