SANTA CRUZ, CA--There's no more lovely setting for an afternoon of  poetry and classical music than the Alan Chadwick Garden at the  University of California, Santa Cruz. With roses in bloom, the garden  will be the backdrop for "A Garden of Poetry and Music," a free public  reading by four poets on Saturday, June 1, from noon until 2 p.m.

Poets who will read their work are:
* Michael Hannon--Discovered by Lawrence Ferlinghetti and  Kenneth Rexroth, Hannon has authored more than fifteen poetry  books, including Poems & Days and Ordinary Messengers. A master of  the short lyric, Hannon is also the author of "My Mother Walked Out,"  a four-page chant considered by some to be one of the best long  poems written in contemporary American poetry.
* Jessica Ruby Simpson--A poet and singer/songwriter,  Simpson has been described as a "spellbinding" reader of her work,  which includes the books Ruby Slippers: Stories by Jessica Ruby  Simpson and Delicate Strange: Poems by Jessica Ruby Simpson.
* Anita Wilkins--An instructor at Cabrillo College, Wilkins  specializes in poetry and international literature. She is the author  of three volumes of poetry and in 1983 received the Pushcart Prize  for Poetry.
* Carolye Kuchta--A student at Cabrillo College, Kuchta was  born and raised in British Columbia, Canada. She has recently  received three writing awards from Cabrillo.

In addition to poetry and music, free food and beverages will  be offered. For those inspired to garden, organic plants raised at the  UCSC Farm and Garden will be available for purchase.

The main entrance to the Alan Chadwick Garden is located on  McLaughlin Drive across from Stevenson College, where free parking  will be available. The reading is sponsored by the Friends of the  UCSC Farm and Garden. For more information, call (408) 459-4140.
