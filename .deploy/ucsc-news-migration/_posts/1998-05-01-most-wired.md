**Campus Is Ranked 24th In Yahoo! Survey Gauging Computer Environments On College Campuses Across The Country**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--UC Santa Cruz is ranked 24th in the country in an Internet magazine's survey assessing the computer environment on the campuses of American colleges and universities. The results of Yahoo! Internet Life's second annual national survey appear in the magazine's May issue.

Among UC campuses that were ranked in the "America's 100 Most Wired Colleges" survey, only UCLA--at No. 23--finished ahead of UCSC. UC Berkeley was ranked 42nd in the county. Dartmouth College, meanwhile, occupied the survey's top spot.

"In rating this year's schools, we took all aspects of the wired campus into account--infrastructure, social life--but we focused primarily on the academic benefits of using the Net," said Ben Greenman, a reporter for Yahoo! Internet Life.

The Internet magazine surveyed more than 400 colleges and universities. The rankings were based on 22 factors, organized under four categories: general services, academics, social life, and computer statistics.

Students at UCSC can register for classes, drop or add courses, read campus publications, and check their grades--all electronically. A large number of classes also use the Net to post study aids and for research.

UCSC also made the "America's 100 Most Wired Colleges" list in the survey's inaugural year, finishing 56th in 1997.

Yahoo! Internet Life is published monthly in a traditional paper format and as an online publication (www.zdnet.com/yil/).
