SANTA CRUZ, CA--Whether you've set sail in search of the Great  White Whale or just an evening of fun, make sure to plot a course to  "A Whale of an Auction," the largest annual fund-raising event for  public education programs at Joseph M. Long Marine Laboratory of UC Santa Cruz.

This year's soiree, the twelfth annual auction, begins at 5:30 p.m. Thursday, March 27, in the Porter College Dining Hall at  UCSC. About 400 people usually attend the auction, which raises  tens of thousands of dollars for the lab's efforts to inform  schoolchildren and the general public about our unique place on the  central coast.

The evening will include an hors-d'oeuvres buffet from  Michael's Catering, champagne and caviar from the docents and  Friends of Long Marine Lab, live music, and silent and live auctions.

Items up for bid will include trips to Hawaii and Mexico; fly  fishing on private streams in Colorado; a behind-the-scenes tour of  Monterey Bay Aquarium; sailing on private yachts on Monterey Bay  and San Francisco Bay; a birthday party for children at Long Marine  Lab; a private flight at Altamont Pass to view golden eagles;  researcher-guided scuba-diving trips in Monterey Bay; stays at local  bed and breakfasts; catered meals; tickets to sporting events;  pottery and other artworks; and jewelry, wines, and scores of other  gifts. Bob Slawinski of the Slawinski Auction Company will conduct  the festivities.

Proceeds help thousands of schoolchildren and visitors to Long  Marine Lab learn about the Monterey Bay marine environment and  marine research at UCSC through the "Window to Discovery" and  other programs. The Friends of Long Marine Lab, sponsor of the  auction, also is raising funds for a new Marine Discovery Center at  the lab.

Tickets are $30 in advance or $35 at the door. For  reservations, call Long Marine Lab at (408) 459-2883.

Donations to the auction or to the lab's education programs are  welcome. For more information, call Sonia Deetz at (408) 459-5828.
