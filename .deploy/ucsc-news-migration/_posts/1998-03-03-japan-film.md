SANTA CRUZ, CA--When a magazine collector in Japan described the allure of  America to young Japanese, he told film director Chip Lord that America has an  "aroma of enchantment." Lord knew he had just heard the title for his  documentary-in-progress. That documentary, The Aroma of Enchantment  (1992), will be cablecast on Community Television, Channel 72, at 8 P.M. on  March 15 and 4:30 P.M. on March 18 on the show UCSC Forum.

The film, which has won a number of awards and been screened in  prestigious film festivals around the world, is a thought-provoking exploration  of the "idea of America" held by many Japanese. These impressions, often  ideals, emerged in large part from the post-World War II American occupation  of Japan and from American advertising images from the 1950s.

The Aroma of Enchantment interweaves historical material on General  MacArthur and the American occupation of Japan with reminiscences by a variety  of Japanese who connect their concept of "America"  to the post-war occupation period, when images of America were powerfully  influential in Japan.

In the film, Lord connects interviews with such people as a magazine  collector and a female jazz singer to his own experiences as a foreigner in  Japan. Since its completion in 1992, the film has been shown in such festivals  as the Hawaii International Film Festival, the Image Forum Festival in Japan,  and the Dallas Video Festival. Awards include the National Educational Film  Festival Award, Hawaii International Film Festival honoree, Image Forum  Festival (Tokyo) honoree, Atlanta Film Festival honoree, Museum of Modern Art  honoree.

Lord is a professor of theater arts at UCSC where he teaches courses in  film and video. He filmed The Aroma of Enchantment during a 1991 fellowship  in Tokyo with the U.S.-Japan Friendship Commission. Lord says that during the  filming he discovered that, "The idea that many Japanese have about America  derives from the post-World War II years and from media images at the time,  such as ads depicting big cars and suburban homes. That Norman Rockwell idea  of America has remained alive in the Japanese imagination."
