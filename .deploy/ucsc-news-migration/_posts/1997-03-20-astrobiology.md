SANTA CRUZ, CA--"Astrobiology," an intriguing new  interdisciplinary research field spanning the origins and evolution of  life on Earth and elsewhere, will be the focus of a "gathering of  minds" at UC Santa Cruz on Saturday, March 22. The daylong  workshop will begin at 8:30 a.m. in room B206, Earth and Marine  Sciences Building. The meeting is not open to the public.

Scientists from UCSC and the NASA Ames Research Center will  convene to discuss astrobiology projects on which the two  institutions might collaborate. UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood  and NASA Ames science administrator David Morrison will address  the assembly.

The meeting illustrates NASA's desire to get university  researchers across the country involved in its new "Origins"  program--a major and long-term research direction to study life in  its many possible manifestations. Further, the National Science  Foundation has announced funding for projects in its "Life in Extreme  Environments" program, ranging from the surfaces of other worlds to  the deepest ocean vents on Earth.

"There is real research to be done in this interdisciplinary  area," said meeting organizer David Deamer, research professor of  chemistry and biochemistry at UCSC. "Collaborations exist between  astronomers, biologists, and chemists here and at NASA Ames. We'd  like to strengthen those ties and extend them into other areas as  well." Those areas, he noted, could include evolutionary biology,  molecular biology, earth sciences, marine sciences, and physics.

Examples of research in astrobiology, Deamer said, include the  quest for extrasolar planets, a project in which UCO/Lick  Observatory astronomers are participating; the search for past or  present life on Mars; the origins of the first genetic systems and the  first cells on Earth; the role of comet or meteorite impacts in the  history of life on Earth; the genesis and survival of life in harsh  conditions; and how life responds to diverse forces, such as climate  changes and prolonged exposure to gravity.
