SANTA CRUZ, CA--For the third year in a row, a faculty member at the  University of California, Santa Cruz, has earned one of the most sought- after awards for young American scientists: a David and Lucile Packard  Fellowship for Science and Engineering, worth $100,000 per year for five  years.

This year's recipient is assistant professor of physics Sue Carter, who  came to UCSC in April. She is among twenty recipients of the 1996 Packard  Fellowships, which recognize scientists who have shown unusual creative  abilities in the first three years of their academic careers.

The David and Lucile Packard Foundation of Los Altos launched its  fellowship program in 1988 and now awards $10 million per year to support  the research of 100 active fellows. The foundation invites about 50  universities to compete for the awards; each university nominates two  scientists. The 1996 winners, announced today (October 4) by the foundation,  represent institutions such as MIT, Caltech, Yale, Johns Hopkins, Duke, and  five campuses in the UC system: UCLA, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa  Barbara, and Santa Cruz.

Only four institutions have received a Packard Fellowship each year  for the last three years: Caltech, the University of Chicago, UC San  Francisco, and UCSC.

"Without question, the Packard Fellows are among the brightest group  of young people in the nation, if not the world," says former presidential  science adviser Allan Bromley of Yale. "Prior to World War II, almost all the  leading scientists and engineers in the country were educated through the  generosity of the Rockefeller and Carnegie foundations. I believe the Packard  Foundation is poised to play the same role as we move into the 21st  century."

Carter studies the chemical and physical properties of substances that  could form the next generation of materials in microelectronics and optical  displays. Today's TV and computer screens, semiconductors, and other  technologies rely on inorganic materials, such as silicon. Carter examines  the relationship between structure and electrical properties in mixtures of  inorganic and organic (carbon-based) compounds. Such substances offer a  tantalizing promise: the durability and reliability of traditional inorganics  combined with the flexibility and environmental advantages of the atoms  and molecules that compose living things.

"The next generation of optoelectronic materials almost certainly will  be both organically and inorganically based," Carter says. "Each type of  material has limitations and advantages, and the key is to combine the best  of both."

Carter creates her own inorganic-organic composites in her lab at  UCSC. She probes the behaviors of long strings, or polymers, of the  composites under different conditions of temperature, chemical  composition, and ultraviolet light. Of particular interest are the shapes,  sizes, and orientation of the particles, as well as their reactions to  electrical impulses.

Eventual applications include new technologies for information  storage, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and liquid-crystal displays (LCDs). For  instance, a polymer-based LED may lead to flat-panel displays which, unlike  LCDs, are equally viewable from any angle. "Electronic paper" is another goal:  portable, foldable black-on-white displays that could profoundly change the  way we access information.

"Inorganic-organic composites should allow researchers to develop  'smart' materials that respond to changes in their surroundings in ways that  purely inorganic materials cannot," Carter says.

Carter will use her $500,000 award to hire a new postdoctoral  researcher and graduate research assistants. She also will purchase a  sophisticated instrument called a scanning tunneling microscope, which can  take images on the scale of individual molecules.

Carter, age 30, earned her B.A. magna cum laude in physics, chemistry,  and mathematics from Kalamazoo College and her Ph.D. in physical chemistry  from the University of Chicago. She worked for two years as a postdoctoral  researcher at AT&T Bell Laboratories-Lucent Technologies in Murray Hill,  New Jersey. Before joining UCSC's faculty, she held a six-month appointment  as the Center for Polymer Interface and Macromolecular Assembly Young  Investigator Fellow at IBM's Almaden Research Center, near San Jose. Her  research program will include extensive ties with collaborators at the  Almaden Research Center and in other high-tech industries.

Preceding Carter as Packard Fellows at UCSC were two members of the  Center for the Molecular Biology of RNA, a leading research group on campus:  biochemist Joseph Puglisi in 1994 and molecular biologist Charles Wilson in  1995\. Both researchers study the structure and function of RNA, a cousin of  DNA that carries out critical tasks in every living cell.

The David and Lucile Packard Foundation, created in 1964, supports and  encourages organizations that depend on private funding and volunteer  leadership. It awards grants to programs in the arts, community, marine  biology, environment, population, education, and children's health.
