**'Statement Of Intent To Register' Figures Forecast Freshman  Enrollment Of 2,532**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--More than 2,500 students have indicated they are  planning to attend the University of California, Santa Cruz, as  freshmen this coming fall. The entering class is expected to be more  ethnically diverse in spite of new regulations that eliminated the use  of race and ethnicity from the university's admissions decisions.

Actual enrollment numbers for freshmen--and the entire  student body--will not be known until classes begin this fall. But  according to information released today (Wednesday, May 20) by  UC's Office of the President, UCSC received "intent to register" notices  from 2,532 prospective freshmenQup from the 2,257 who indicated  at this time last year that they planned to enroll in fall 1997. Actual  freshman enrollment this past fall quarter was 2,127.

Previously admitted high school seniors had until May 1 to file  a Statement of Intent to Register (SIR) form with UCSC--or with other  UC campuses.

Of the total number of freshman SIRs received by UCSC, 438  identified themselves as African American, Chicano, Latino, or  American Indian--students whose ethnicities are underrepresented  in the UC system--compared to 352 in these ethnic groups last year.  (For a breakdown of ethnicities, see table, attached.)

In addition, 421 of UCSC's prospective freshmen identified  themselves as Asian/Asian American or Filipino/Filipino American,  compared to 369 last year. Although not underrepresented in the UC  system, these ethnicities are underrepresented at UCSC.

The increase in the number of underrepresented students  comes despite passage of Proposition 209 by state voters in  November 1996 and SP-1 by UC's Board of Regents in July 1995.  Within the University of California system, both measures banned  the use of race, ethnicity, and gender in admissions decisions.

"In no small part the reason that the underrepresented student  numbers increased this fall was the extra efforts made by our  student organizations and their members to lay out a welcome mat  for our prospective students," said M.R.C. Greenwood, chancellor of  UCSC. "Faculty and staff efforts were also essential to our success-- writing letters, making telephone calls, and meeting with visitors to  our campus."

"We're extremely pleased with the new fall class," added  Francisco J. Hernandez, UCSC's vice chancellor for student affairs.  "These are wonderful students, they represent the state well, and  we're looking forward to having them here."

With assistance from the Chancellor's Office and the Office of  the President, Student Affairs funded $78,000 in student-initiated  outreach activities this past fall, said J. Michael Thompson, associate  vice chancellor for enrollment management and director of  admissions at UCSC. The students spoke at their former high schools  and community colleges, acted as hosts for applicants visiting the  campus, and participated in phonathons and events they had created.

For many years, UCSC has accepted all students who apply to  the campus and are eligible for UC admission. Starting with the  admissions process for fall 1999, UCSC will no longer have room to  admit all students who apply and are eligible, Thompson said.
