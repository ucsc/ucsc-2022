SANTA CRUZ, CA--Amandla Poets, an acclaimed South African World Beat  band, will headline a benefit concert for the UCSC Farm & Garden on Friday,  October 3, at the Santa Cruz Veterans Memorial Building on Front Street in  downtown Santa Cruz. Dandaro, Santa Cruz's favorite marimba group, will  open the show at 8 P.M.

With a full rhythm section and two vocalists, Amandla Poets is a  seven-member band that offers an infectious South African reggae groove,  sweet vocal harmonies, and energetic dance combinations. The Poets' music  is solidly rooted in South African township rhythms but has been described  as a "transcontinental stew" of jazz, R&B, reggae, and African-inspired  rhythms. The group's 1996 CD, Makube Njaio (Make It So), was nominated for  outstanding World Beat album of the year at last year's Bay Area Music  Awards.

Tickets for the benefit concert are $10 and are available at New Leaf  Market in Felton and at the UCSC Farm & Garden Market Cart on Tuesdays and  Fridays from noon to 6 P.M. at the base of campus at the corner of Bay and  High Streets. Tickets can also be purchased the night of the show or ordered  in advance by calling (408) 459-3248.

Proceeds from the concert benefit the UCSC Farm & Garden's  Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture, a six-month training program in  organic farming and gardening. The concert is part of the Farm & Garden's  30th Anniversary Celebration, taking place from Friday, October 3, through  Sunday, October 5. For more information about the concert or anniversary  festivities, including the Harvest Festival and Celebration Organic Dinner,  call Wendy Krupnick at (408) 459-3248.
