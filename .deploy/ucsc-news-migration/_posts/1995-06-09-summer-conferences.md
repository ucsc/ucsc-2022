SANTA CRUZ, CA--The Conference Office at the University of  California, Santa Cruz, will host more than 50 conferences,  symposia, meetings, institutes, and camps this summer, on subjects  ranging from Summer Bridge, a program to acquaint incoming  freshmen with UCSC, to invertebrate reproduction.

The ten-week conference season is expected to bring roughly  13,000 visitors to the campus between late June and early  September. Some conferences introduce a diverse group of students  to UCSC and promote enrollment. Others feature faculty and staff in  their areas of expertise. Approximately 60 percent of summer  bookings come from UC Extension, UCSC Summer Session, and  academic programs sponsored by faculty and staff. Youth groups,  businesses, sports teams, and government and professional  organizations make up the remaining 40 percent of bookings.

The conference program generates roughly $3 million each year  for UCSC. In addition to purchasing food and professional services  from the campus, conference guests occupy the 2,400 beds at the  campus's eight residential colleges during the season. The income  generated helped to offset room-and-board rates charged to UCSC  students by about $200 last year. The conference program also  employs more than 30 students.

Some of this year's conferences include:
* "Reading Our Mutual Friend: Charles Dickens and Serial  Production" (June 25-July 29). At this conference, twenty-five high  school and community college teachers will read Dickens's last  complete novel in serial installments and discuss the social and  political context of the work. The conference is supported by a  National Endowment for the Humanities grant and presented by the  Dickens Project.
* West Coast Dowsers (June 29-July 5). An annual conference  on the art of finding water, oil, and gold with a diving rod, West  Coast Dowsers brings approximately 110 people to campus each year. A dowsing school will be offered Friday, June 30, for  people interested in learning how to dowse.
* Summer Bridge Program (July 8-August 11). This  challenging five-week academic program prepares incoming  freshmen for college-level work at UCSC. One hundred students will  take part in the program, which includes academic, social, and  cultural activities designed to help students become familiar with  the campus.
* Marine Activities, Resources, and Education (MARE, July 9- 21). This twelve-day residential institute offers hands-on  instruction for teachers using the MARE program, a marine science- based curriculum for students in kindergarten through eighth grade.  UC Berkeley's Lawrence Hall of Science sponsors this conference,  which features guest speakers, fieldwork, and leadership training  for 40 teachers from northern California schools.
* Camp Santa Cruz (three one-week sessions, July 16-August  4). As many as 85 children ages eight to fifteen will come to UCSC  each session for a week of tennis, volleyball, jazz dance, martial  arts, sailing, and a variety of other sports-related activities. UCSC  teachers and coaches, and other instructors lead the camp; evening  activities include a trip to the Boardwalk, a beach barbecue, and a  talent show and dance.
* Dickens Universe (July 30-August 5). Scholars, graduate  students, teachers, and the general public will focus on Great  Expectations by Dickens and Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte during the  annual conference, which is sponsored by the Dickens Project.
* The Seventh International Congress on Invertebrate  Reproduction (August 5-11). More than 250 people from around the  globe will attend this conference on the reproductive biology of  invertebrates. This is the first time the international congress has  met in the United States since 1979.
