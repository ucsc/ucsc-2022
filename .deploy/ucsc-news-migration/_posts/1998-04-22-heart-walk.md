SANTA CRUZ, CA--The American Heart Association's annual American Heart Walk takes place this year on Saturday, May 2, at Seacliff State Beach in Aptos. Companies and individuals are being sought to participate in this worthy fund-raising event, both in the 10K and 5K walk/run and as volunteers.

M.R.C. Greenwood, chancellor of the University of California, Santa Cruz, is serving as chair of this year's event. "I am proud to support this event and the American Heart Association, which has made such a difference over the years in the battle against the nation's number one killers--heart disease and stroke," she said. "I encourage everyone to come join us as we celebrate good health and support a worthy cause. On May 2, your walk or run can do good not only for your own heart, but for the thousands of people the association serves."

This year, the walk will also celebrate the 10-year anniversary of Dominican Hospital's Cardiac Surgery Program. Dr. Noel H. Fishman, director of cardiac surgery at Dominican, will lead a "Red Cap Salute" to the survivors of heart disease and stroke. These survivors will be wearing red caps.

Companies and individuals interested in participating in the walk should call the number below. Participants are asked to obtain pledges for either the 10K or 5K walk or run. Registration runs from 8 to 8:45 a.m. on May 2 and the race begins at 9 a.m. Along with the race, there will be blood pressure checks, musical performances, and a continental breakfast will be served.

Additional support for the event comes from the Holiday Inn of Santa Cruz, TCI Cablevision, Santa Cruz Natural Springs, and KISE 103.9-FM.
