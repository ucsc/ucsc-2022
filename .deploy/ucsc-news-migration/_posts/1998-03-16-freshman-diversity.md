**Focus Is On Outreach Efforts To Ensure Top Academic Quality And Ethnic Diversity In Post-prop. 209 Era**

The University of California, Santa Cruz, has announced the release of  letters of admission to freshmen applying to enter UCSC in fall 1998. Issuance  of letters of admission is an early step in the process leading to actual  enrollments of students next September. Among UC-eligible freshman  applicants admitted to Santa Cruz, there is an increase of underrepresented  students (8.4%/148).  Moreover, these admitted students reflect higher levels of academic  achievement in SAT scores and GPA compared to those admitted last year. (See  next page for summary of admitted students by ethnicity.)

**Administrative Comment**

"We had projected a downturn of 109 underrepresented minorities for this  entering class, due to the implementation of the UC Regents' SP1 and Prop. 209,"  noted Associate Vice Chancellor for Enrollment Management/Director of  Admissions J. Michael Thompson. "Now, we anticipate at least maintaining the  same numbers of underrepresented students when the fall class is finalized-- and that fact underscores the effective and creative effort of the entire campus  to continue our traditions of excellence and inclusion. "

**Yield Efforts**

Among specific outreach activities to prospective freshmen are the  following:
* Phone-a-thon--Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood joined students and faculty in  phoning prospective students during the week of March 9. The purpose of the  calls was to answer questions about UCSC and to personalize the invitation to  enroll at the campus.
* Scholars' Day--Nearly 200 students (and more than 500 participants,  including family members) attended an information fair and presentations by  faculty on Saturday, March 14. The third annual event to bring the top 7% of  freshman applicants to the campus, this year's Scholars' Day welcomed students  with an average GPA of 4.17 and average SAT scores of 1404. In addition to  many California students, attendees included applicants from Canada, Alaska,  Illinois, Minnesota, Montana, Arizona and Washington.
* Banana Slug Spring Fair--Scheduled for Saturday, April 18, this annual  campus open house is an opportunity for prospective students and their families  to visit the campus, meet faculty, staff and other students and learn more about  UCSC's programs and services.

**General Background**

Calendar of UC Admissions Process

(Note: Final actual enrollment figures are available only at the end of the  following five-step process. Although there may be benchmark indicators at the  various steps, the most significant number--the actual enrollment--results  from the final matriculation in fall of each year.)

1) Students apply by November 30; many students apply to multiple  campuses.
2) Individual campuses notify admitted students during March.
3) Campuses engage in "yield" efforts during March and April to encourage  students to select from among the campuses to which they have been admitted.
4) Students file Statements of Intent to Register by May 1 at the UC  campus at which they plan to enroll.
5) Students complete matriculation processes within the first three  weeks of the fall academic period.
