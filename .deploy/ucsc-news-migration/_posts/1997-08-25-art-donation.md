**Living Trust Of Charles Griffin Farr Identifies UC Santa Cruz As Recipient Of His Private Collection**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Charles Griffin Farr, one of California's great  realist painters and a veteran of the San Francisco art scene, died  August 5 at the age of 89.

Farr, described not long ago by a reporter as "the grand old man  of the San Francisco art scene," is considered a master of the  American Realist tradition. Born in 1908 in Birmingham, Alabama, he  painted for more than 70 years. In his youth, he studied in New York  City and at the Academie Americaine in Paris. Farr began his move  westward after serving in the army in World War II, arriving in San  Francisco in 1948 where he lived until his death.

This past year Farr donated a dozen of his paintings and  drawings to the Mary Porter Sesnon Art Gallery at the University of  California, Santa Cruz. Some 100 people attended a January  reception to honor Farr. The reception took place at University  House, the residence of UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood, where  Farr's works continue to be on display. At the time, Greenwood  noted, "It is a delight both to live with and share with others the  work of one of America's great contemporary painters. Mr. Farr's gift  will be an exceptional resource for future UCSC artists."

"Charles Griffin Farr was a wonderful artist and teacher and a  generous man," says Sesnon Gallery curator Pamela Bailey. "We are  honored to be entrusted with this gift. As part of UCSC's permanent  collection, the extraordinary works of Charles Griffin Farr will be  preserved for the appreciation and education of generations to  come."

Farr learned of UCSC in 1990 when Rolando Castellon, curator  of the Sesnon Gallery at the time, invited the artist to exhibit his  work here. Farr, who taught for nearly a decade at the San Francisco  Art Institute, was impressed by the campus's art program and  decided to donate his works to the gallery's permanent collection,  making his work accessible to students and the general public.

Farr's work is on display in public collections at the National  Museum of American Art in Washington, D.C., the Oakland Museum of  California, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and at UCSC.  Major exhibitions of Farr's work are planned for the next year both  at UCSC and in San Francisco. Farr is survived by his nephews, Tom  Davis and William Davis, both of Knoxville, Tenn.
