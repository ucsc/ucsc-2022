SANTA CRUZ, CA--Biological oceanographer Bess Ward, a professor  of ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz, has received one of the top  awards in her field: the 1997 G. Evelyn Hutchinson Award from the  American Society of Limnology and Oceanography.

Ward, age 42, is both the youngest recipient and the first  woman to receive the prestigious honor, which the society has  bestowed annually since 1982. The award recognizes outstanding  midcareer scientists who exemplify the standards of scholarship  and creativity set by the late G. Evelyn Hutchinson, a pioneering  ecologist at Yale University. A remarkable number of his students  have gone on to become international leaders in aquatic ecology.

Ward's citation, in part, describes her "pioneering applications  of molecular methods to key conversions of nitrogen and methane."  In essence, Ward studies how quickly bacteria convert these  substances from one form to another. Bacteria can oxidize methane  into carbon dioxide, for instance, and can transform ammonium into  nitrate. Such reactions are ubiquitous and vital to life cycles and  biogeochemical cycles in agricultural fields, lakes, the ocean, and  elsewhere.

Ward has helped to introduce the most modern techniques from  molecular biology to her field. For example, she uses immunological  methods to probe nitrifying bacteria in the ocean. As an important  and fundamentally limiting nutrient in the ocean, nitrogen controls  the rate at which small plants grow--and hence the rate at which  ocean life removes carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, from the  atmosphere.

Ward's research group also studies the effects of similar  bacteria in nearby ecosystems, such as Elkhorn Slough and San  Francisco Bay. The organisms are potentially useful as  "bioremediators" to help clean petroleum, herbicides, and other toxic  materials from the water and marshes.

Ward received her B.S. in zoology from Michigan State  University and her Ph.D. in oceanography from the University of  Washington. She joined UCSC's faculty in 1989 and now chairs the  Ocean Sciences Department.
