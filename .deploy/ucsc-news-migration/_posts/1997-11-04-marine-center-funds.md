![\[Artist's rendering of Marine Discovery Center\]][1] An artist's conception portrays the Marine Discovery Center, now in the early phases of construction next to Long Marine Lab. The $5.3 million center will triple Long Marine Lab's capacity to educate schoolchildren and the general public about the marine environment. To date, private donors have contributed about two-thirds of the project's cost.

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Nearly $800,000 worth of gifts have helped the  Marine Discovery Center, a public education facility under  construction at the Joseph M. Long Marine Laboratory in Santa Cruz,  move substantially closer to reality.

The gifts include a $500,000 matching grant from the David  and Lucile Packard Foundation of Los Altos and two $100,000  donations from area residents. They bring the total raised to date  for the Marine Discovery Center to about $3.2 million--roughly two-thirds of the $4.7 million amount needed to fund the center's  construction.

Project coordinators at UC Santa Cruz also hope to raise an  additional $600,000 to finance the center's exhibits. All of the  project funds, except for $500,000 from the University of California  for a teaching laboratory, are being raised from private sources.

Contractors will pour the center's foundation within the next  two weeks at a dramatic oceanfront site overlooking the Monterey  Bay National Marine Sanctuary. When completed late next year, the  center will triple Long Marine Lab's capacity to educate  schoolchildren and the public about the marine environment.  Operated by UCSC, Long Marine Lab is the only marine research lab in  the state--and one of just a few in the country--to open its doors  for educational activities and tours.

"Long Marine Lab's education programs focus on the critical  importance of the oceans to the health of our planet," said Robert  Stephens, cochair of the center's Capital Campaign Committee. "The  Marine Discovery Center will greatly enhance those programs with a  spacious new building in a beautiful setting."

Added Gurden Mooser, cochair of the Capital Campaign  Committee: "We deeply appreciate the continued support for this  project from the Packard Foundation and from our generous private  donors. It is clear that our community recognizes the value of the  Marine Discovery Center for our children and for the general public."

The latest gifts are as follows:
* The Packard Foundation's commitment of $500,000, which  UCSC must match with an additional $500,000 raised from other  sources. This gift continues the foundation's strong support of  marine-related research and education at UCSC, most notably via a  previous $200,000 matching grant to the Marine Discovery Center  and a $1 million endowment for research in ocean sciences and  technology.
* $100,000 from Mary and Dick Solari of Aptos. Dick Solari,  former chairman and president of Granite Construction Co., and his  wife Mary have long supported the needs of children in the  community, including a recent $100,000 challenge grant to the  Pajaro Valley Children's Shelter. They also gave $25,000 to Long  Marine Lab last year.
* $100,000 from Phyllis Simpkins of Santa Cruz. Phyllis  Simpkins and her late husband, Alan Simpkins, have been integral  supporters of the Friends of Long Marine Lab's auction, a major  annual fund-raising event. Their philanthropy in the educational  community has been notable, particularly their major donations to  athletic programs at their alma mater, San Jose State University.
* $50,000 from Bob and Carol Simpkins of Santa Cruz and  $15,000 from Bill and Brigid Simpkins of Santa Cruz. Bob and Bill  Simpkins, both sons of Phyllis Simpkins, are closely involved with  UCSC. Bob Simpkins is a member of the Board of Directors of the  Friends of Long Marine Lab and the center's Capital Campaign  Committee. Bill and Brigid Simpkins recently donated $20,000 to  help establish a water polo team at UCSC.
* $25,000 from Brad, James, and Victor Bogard at the Bogard  Construction Co. of Santa Cruz, general contractor for the Marine  Discovery Center.
