SANTA CRUZ, CA--Two recent gifts to the University of California, Santa  Cruz, from Santa Cruz residents Grace and Michael Jacobs have established  scholarship funds to support students in environmental studies and the  campus's re-entry program.

A $10,000 gift from the couple has created the David Gaines  Endowment Fund in Environmental Studies in memory of David Gaines, a UCSC  graduate who fought for the preservation of Mono Lake. The fund supports the  David Gaines Award in Environmental Studies at UC Santa Cruz, which is  offered to students to help cover the expenses of field projects that will  make a "significant contribution to the solution of an environmental  problem." Awards will be based on scholastic merit, demonstrated  initiative, and project feasibility.

David Gaines founded the Mono Lake Committee in 1978 and spent 10  years enlisting support for the lake from environmentalists and others  around the country. He was killed in an automobile accident in 1988. In part  because of Gaines's work, water levels at Mono Lake were returned to levels  that saved the lake and its surrounding wildlife. Mono Lake is now a state  reserve. Since 1989, Grace Jacobs, David's aunt, has given $1,000 to the  campus annually to fund awards for environmental studies students.  Seventeen students have received awards to date.

A second gift of $10,000 has established the Marilyn Justman  Endowment Fund to aid re-entry students. The endowment honors the memory  of Marilyn Justman, an aunt of Grace Jacobs, and creates the Marilyn  Justman Award for the Re-Entry Services Program, which will provide a  minimum $1,000 annual scholarship award. Awards will be given to  undergraduate or graduate women re-entry students, and preference will be  given to students with financial need.

The Jacobses plan to augment support for both programs through  annual gifts and, with the help of friends and others, build the respective  endowments to $20,000 each, at which point the scholarships will be self- supporting.
