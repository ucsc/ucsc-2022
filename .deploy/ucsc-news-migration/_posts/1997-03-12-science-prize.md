SANTA CRUZ, CA--Seismologist Marino Protti, who received his Ph.D. from  the UC Santa Cruz Earth Sciences Department in 1994, has won the National  Prize in Science from the Ministry of Science and Technology in Costa Rica.

Protti, a professor at the Observatorio Vulcanologico y Sismologico de  Costa Rica (OVSICORI), shared the prize with a mathematician from the  Costa Rican national university. He is the first earth scientist to receive the  prize, which the government awards every other year.

Protti was recognized for his work at OVSICORI and for a paper  analyzing the subduction of the Cocos oceanic crustal plate beneath Costa  Rica and southern Nicaragua, which causes major earthquakes. That paper,  coauthored with OVSICORI's Federico Güendel (who earned his Ph.D. from  UCSC in 1986) and UCSC professor of earth sciences Karen McNally, appeared  in Geologic and Tectonic Development of the Caribbean Plate Boundary in  Southern Central America, a special volume published in 1995 by the  Geological Society of America.
