"The collaborative being developed at NASA-Ames by UC Santa Cruz, San Jose State University, and the Foothill-De Anza Community College District offers a location and an opportunity to demonstrate how institutions--representing the three segments of higher education in California--can come together to serve the state and its citizens in unique ways. This project presents a model for the new century."
