SANTA CRUZ, CA--A professor from North Carolina has joined the University  of California, Santa Cruz, as an American Council on Education (ACE) Fellow  for the 1996-97 academic year.

Kathleen Kish was most recently head of the Department of Romance  Languages at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro--a position  from which she took leave to come to Santa Cruz. She is one of only 34 ACE  Fellows nationwide for 1996-97.

The ACE Fellows Program is designed to strengthen the leadership of  American higher education. Through seminars, extensive study, and mentor  relationships with administrators at their host institutions, the promising  faculty and staff who are named as ACE Fellows prepare themselves to take  high-level positions in university administration sometime in the future.

Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood is acting as Kish's primary mentor for the  fellowship year.

While at UCSC, Kish plans to gain a broader understanding of the issues  and challenges affecting higher education, she says. She is exploring ways to  increase access to higher education, ensure its quality, and promote the  diversity of its students. She is also helping UCSC forge partnerships with  other educational institutions, community organizations, and businesses. A specialist in Spanish literature, Kish earned a bachelor's degree in  Spanish from UC Berkeley and master's and Ph.D. degrees in Spanish from the  University of Wisconsin-Madison. She has studied in Spain as a Fulbright  scholar and received grants from such agencies as the National Endowment  for the Humanities and the American Council of Learned Societies.

Kish has published two books and a number of articles on early  translations of the Spanish masterpiece Celestina, a work of prose fiction in  21 acts that became a best-seller in sixteenth-century Europe. Her other  publications have centered on the multisecular Hispanic ballad tradition and  on eighteenth-century Spanish letters.

ACE's membership includes more than 1,600 degree-granting  institutions and more than 200 higher-education associations and  organizations nationwide.
