SANTA CRUZ, CA--The University of California, Santa Cruz, Student  Health Services has received the highest possible rating from the  Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care, Inc. (AAAHC),  in conjunction with the Institute for Medical Quality.

The accreditation means that the health center has met  nationally recognized standards for quality health care set by  AAAHC and the California Medical Association, said Student Health  Services director Anita Diaz. Student Health Services provides  primary health care and educational services to UCSC students.

"We're pleased and proud to have been awarded this recognition  of our work," said Diaz. "Accreditation is very important and has  helped improve the quality of care we provide. It is evidence that  health center staff are providing excellent services on a daily  basis."

During the accreditation process, a group of physicians  surveyed the health center's facilities, business practices, and  services, evaluating all aspects of patient care, said Diaz.
