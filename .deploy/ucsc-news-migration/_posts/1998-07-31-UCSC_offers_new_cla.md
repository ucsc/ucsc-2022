## UC Santa Cruz Offers New Classes On Healing Plants And Medicinal Herbs

SANTA CRUZ, CA--New classes on healing plants and medicinal herbs will be offered this summer by the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

The first class, Exploring Healing Plants of the UCSC Farm & Garden, will take place Saturday, August 15, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.

Participants will spend the day learning about the healing properties of commonly cultivated fruits and vegetables, medicinal herbs that are easily grown by the home gardener, and the role plants play in maintaining the well-being of our bodies and gardens. The focus will be on plants typically found growing in home gardens. Topics will include medicinal plant and edible weed identification, the healing properties of fruits and vegetables, and soil management practices that enhance food vitality.

The course fee is $30 for the general public; $25 for members of the UCSC Farm & Garden. Class enrollment is limited; preregistration and payment are due by August 11. The class will meet at the Louise Cain Gatehouse at the UCSC Farm. A limited number of work-trade positions will be available. Participants will collect wild greens and flowers for an exotic lunch salad but are asked to bring a potluck item to share.

The second class is a weekend intensive course. Herbs for the Gardener will take place on September 19-20 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. each day.

Join aspiring herbalist Darren Huckle, a graduate of the UCSC Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture, to learn about gardening with medicinal herbs. Many common herbal remedies can be successfully grown, prepared, and used by the home gardener. There are also many herbs that commonly appear in local gardens. This class will focus on the basics of garden-based herbal medicine, including medicinal plant identification, preparing and planting herb beds, cultural requirements of common herbs, and making medicines from the garden. The first day of class will meet at the Gatehouse on the UCSC Farm, and the second day at local herbalist Christopher Hobb's Living Farmacy in Bonny Doon. There will be a potluck lunch on both days.

The fee is $60 for the general public; $50 for members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden Class enrollment is limited; preregistration and payment are due by September 11. A limited number of work-trade positions will be available.

Both classes are being sponsored by the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems and the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden.
