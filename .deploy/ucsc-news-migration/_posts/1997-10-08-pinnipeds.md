**No Other Research Group Has Learned So Much About How Seals And Sea Lions Process Information**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--A remarkable quartet of trained marine mammals  is helping scientists push the frontiers of animal psychobiology by  demonstrating, in unprecedented detail, how they see, hear, and  think about the world around them.

Years of careful experiments at the University of California,  Santa Cruz, have painted a fascinating picture of the sensory and  cognitive experiences of pinnipeds--the four-flippered, amphibious  carnivores that include elephant seals, sea lions, and harbor seals.  Their awareness of the world, it seems, has evolved to meet both  the general needs of marine mammals and the special challenges  each species faces in day-to-day life.

The research is revealing how human impacts might hinder a  pinniped's abilities to identify family or foe, communicate, navigate,  and solve other problems. The work also illuminates the roots of  language development: At least one of the animals can form complex  nonverbal relationships among objects, an ability that some  researchers had ascribed only to humans.

"Animal behavior is intriguing because they don't have  language--they don't code the world around them in symbols, as  humans do," said Ronald Schusterman, adjunct professor of biology  and ocean sciences at UC Santa Cruz. "Yet they do so many intricate  things, both socially and in terms of foraging, navigating, and  avoiding predators like great white sharks and pods of killer whales.  These behaviors are very versatile and flexible. Our animals aren't  thinking verbally, but we know that they're thinking."

Schusterman's team, based at UCSC's Joseph M. Long Marine  Laboratory on the shores of Monterey Bay, has earned a reputation as  one of the best in the world for studying the intelligence of marine  mammals. In recent years, the researchers have extended their focus  beyond animal cognition to encompass the broader issue of how their  subjects gather and process information--in essence, mapping the  "perceptual world" of a pinniped.

"We take an integrated and systematic approach to studying  problem solving in our animals," said marine biologist Colleen  Reichmuth, who received her master's degree under Schusterman.  "It's difficult to do that if you don't understand what kind of sensory  information the animal takes in from its environment."

All of the blubbery and engaging actors in this scientific play  were born in captivity or rescued as stranded orphans. Their training  and research sessions are voluntary, refined to precise protocols  during Schusterman's four decades in animal experimental  psychology.

Two of the animals are female California sea lions (Zalophus  californianus). Rocky, the eldest at age 21, mastered a sign language  under Schusterman in the 1980s. Her cautious approach to new  experiences reflects her one year in the wild as a pup. Rio, hand- raised at the lab and now age 12, is like an eager and demanding  child. By all appearances she loves her role as a scientific pioneer,  splashing excitedly from task to task and excelling at all of them.

Sprouts, a nine-year-old male Pacific harbor seal (Phoca  vitulina richardsii), is laid back compared to his raucous neighbors  but has yielded important insights in the vision and hearing projects.  Four-year-old Burnyce, the world's only trained northern elephant  seal (Mirounga angustirostris), can be stubborn and sluggish. But  she's caught on surprisingly well and has offered glimpses of the  amazing evolutionary adaptations of these deep-diving animals.

"All of them are fun to work with and wonderful to train," said  Schusterman. "There's a lot of similarities between them and us.  They have emotions and motivations, just as we do, and many of the  same basic needs. The ways in which we and they react to the world  are not all that different."

Following are brief overviews of research highlights from each  of the three project areas.

**Cognition: Precursors to language?**
An apparatus that looks similar to the child's game  "Concentration" has garnered the group much attention over the  years.

Schusterman's coworkers train Rocky and Rio to match pairs of  pictures, exposed within small windows in a poolside wooden frame.  For each correct pairing (identified by the sea lion with a touch of  its nose), the animal gets a fish. We see each symbol as a letter, or a  flower, or a teapot--but to the sea lions, they're just random shapes.

Once the animals learn many pairings, the researchers examine  what choices they make when given new combinations. If "A" goes  with "B," for instance, and "B" goes with "C," would the sea lions  deduce instantly that "C" goes with "A"? About five years ago, the  team demonstrated that at least one animal--Rio--could do this, and  do it easily.

Many researchers had believed that spoken language was a  prerequisite for this ability, called "equivalence." Instead, some  animals may possess cognitive skills that linguists would regard as  forerunners of language, even though the animals obviously are  nonverbal.

More recent work, led by Reichmuth, has strengthened this  conclusion by showing that Rio also can form "functional classes,"  another complex task. Rio learned to sort shapes, in this case letters  and numbers, into different categories. After she mastered this  skill, Rio immediately could relate the members within each class  to one another. She also could expand the classes to include new  letters and numbers.

These skills, the researchers claim, cannot stem simply from  instinct or trial and error. Rather, it appears that more complicated  thought processes are innate--at least to Rio, and perhaps to other  members of her species as well.

Why should a sea lion have these abilities when it can't say out  loud what it's thinking? It all boils down to problem solving in the  environment, Schusterman believes. To survive, a lone pup among  thousands on a beach must recognize its mother across the different  senses of sight, smell, and sound--and vice versa. Adults must  classify their kin, recognize which predators to avoid, and navigate  in three dimensions. The skills they've found in Rio, the group  maintains, could form the basis of a cognitive mechanism that sea  lions use to cope in the wild.

"You'd be hard pressed to think of any problem in your life that  doesn't require you to use language to solve it," said marine  biologist David Kastak, who earned his Ph.D. in Schusterman's group.  "Other animals are solving similar complex problems, but without  language."

**Hearing: The din of the ocean**
Pinnipeds may not talk, but they growl, bellow, snort, whine,  and caterwaul with abandon. All of this helps make the ocean and  onshore breeding grounds very noisy places indeed. Add the  cacophony of civilization and industry, and one might wonder how  marine mammals hear what they need to hear.

Schusterman's group wondered that, too. So, led by Kastak, the  team undertook a methodical effort to gauge the hearing abilities of  its four charges, both in air and in water. They devised an  experimental setup that is analogous to the classic hearing test for  humans: Wear headphones, raise your hand when you hear a tone. A child might get a lollipop for performing well on this test, but  Burnyce and her gang get fish.

For the aerial tests, the group directs tones into the animals'  ears via headphones held on by nylon straps. Under water, sounds  emanate from a speaker. Each subject is trained to touch a ball with  its nose if it hears--or thinks it hears--a sound. "False alarms,"  when the animal touches the ball even though no sound was played,  help the researchers spot overeager cheating.

The team tested each animal at different frequencies of sound,  from low- to high-pitched, to create baseline "audiograms." The  results, compared across species, were remarkably reflective of the  animals' evolutionary histories:
* The California sea lions hear well in air but are less  sensitive in water. Many important social interactions for this  species occur on land, Kastak explained. Most critical are the mutual  and unique acoustic identifications between mothers and pups.
* Sprouts, the harbor seal, hears equally well in air and in  water. Of the three species the harbor seal is most truly amphibious,  giving birth on land but breeding and socializing extensively in  water. Unlike sea lion pups, young harbor seals swim soon after  birth.
* Burnyce hears far better in water. That's no shock, as  elephant seals spend an extraordinary amount of time in water up to  a mile deep. Their ear canals are very narrow, probably to prevent  pressure-induced problems at great depths. This may explain why  elephant seal rookeries can get so deafening, Kastak said--they're  all basically hard of hearing in air.

The group was surprised to find that Burnyce hears fairly well  at high frequencies. Many researchers had assumed that elephant  seals were low-frequency specialists, based on the anatomies of  their ears. Detecting high frequencies may help them avoid a key  predator, the killer whale, which echolocates with high-pitched  clicks.

In ongoing work, the team is finding that exposure to loud  sounds can induce "temporary threshold shifts," or slight but  transient hearing losses, in their animals. Just as our ears feel  cottony after a rock concert, it appears that marine mammals lose  some sensitivity if they venture near a tanker or a seismic survey  explosion. For a short time, they might not hear the grunting erotica  of a potential mate or the plaintive "Mom?" of a pup.

Schusterman first measured evidence of this effect in Sprouts  when workers cleaned a nearby tank at Long Marine Lab with a sand  blaster. Now, under controlled conditions, the researchers are  showing that even moderate sounds can induce threshold shifts for a  few hours. For ethical reasons, the team will not study permanent  hearing loss, although it probably does occur in the ocean.

"Manmade noise, especially shipping traffic, is far more of a  pollutant than anything else humans have put into the water," said  Kastak. "It's not innocuous. If we can quantify the impacts of these  sounds on our animals, we might be able to make predictions about  the environmental effects."

Other current research, coordinated by graduate student  Brandon Southall, is probing the "masking" effects of continuous  sounds in our increasingly noisy seas. A persistent sound, even if not  loud enough to have a physiological impact, might prevent marine  mammals from hearing what they need to hear at a given moment.  Then again, they may have evolved the ability to pick out key signals,  just as we can isolate one conversation from a cocktail-party buzz.

**Vision: To the depths, darkly**
Do pinnipeds *hear* their prey, or do they *see* them?  Schusterman's hypothesis is that it's both, but primarily the latter:  Those big watery eyes just soak up photons, even at great depths.

If that's the case, then deeper diving animals should have more  sensitive eyesight, since they need to forage at lower levels of  light. Graduate student David Levenson has explored that notion over  the past few years with a pair of innovative experiments on Rio,  Sprouts, and Burnyce. (Rocky, who has age-related cataracts, sat  this one out.)

First, Levenson trained the animals to remain still in a  darkened room while facing a device that let him control, with  precision, the amount of light shining into their eyes. With an  infrared camera, he measured the dilation of their pupils at  different brightnesses, ranging from ambient light to near darkness.

Burnyce, whose species routinely plummets from the bright  ocean's surface to the shadowy depths below, proved the most dark- adaptable of the three. Indeed, her pupils were still constricted--a  sign of greater sensitivity--at a light intensity about 100,000  times dimmer than the levels at which Rio's and Sprouts' pupils had  become fully dilated. "No one expected that," Levenson said. "It's an  unbelievably huge difference."

In the second set of experiments, Levenson zeroed in on the  faintest flashes of light that the animals could *perceive*--a more  robust indicator of their visual capacities. He built a light-tight  enclosure over a small pool, in which each subject floated while  watching for the light. Just as in the hearing tests, a correct  response (touching nose to ball when the light flashed) netted a fish.  Levenson monitored the animals' actions via a small infrared camera  and adjusted the intensity of the flashing light from above the pool  with a clever system of filters.

Again, Burnyce detected flashes at far lower levels than her  companions. Rio was slightly better than Sprouts, a sensible result  because California sea lions forage almost exclusively at night.  However, with just one experimental subject for each species, the  team can't draw too many broad-based conclusions about their kin in  the wild.

"We pretty much understand what pinnipeds do on land, but  many of their behaviors in the ocean are a black box," Levenson said.  "This provides us with some baseline biological evidence of how  their aquatic visual systems might work." Scientists have not yet  ruled out that pinnipeds also might echolocate on occasion or use  other nonvisual means to listen or feel for prey, Levenson said.  However, his results show that for many species, vision probably is  the most important sense.

A better grasp of the visual abilities and limitations of  various pinnipeds, Schusterman noted, could help inform  conservation management plans. Oil spills, nearshore pollution, or  sedimentation that increases the opacity of water might cut the  animals' odds of finding a meal.
