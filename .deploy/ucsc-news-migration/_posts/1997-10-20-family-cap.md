SANTA CRUZ, CA--A new study of welfare recipients across the country  reveals that welfare mothers in states that offer larger benefit increases  per additional child do not appear to be more likely to have another child  than those in states with lower benefit increases per additional child. The  study, which appears in the current issue of the Journal of Policy Analysis  and Management (vol. 16, no. 4, fall 1997), suggests that recent efforts to  hold down birthrates by capping welfare benefits may be misguided.

The study, entitled "The Effect of Incremental Benefit Levels on Births  to AFDC Recipients," was coauthored by Robert Fairlie, an assistant  professor of economics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and  Rebecca London, a visiting research associate at UCSC when the research  was conducted and now a senior analyst with Berkeley Planning Associates  in Oakland.

"There does not appear to be a relationship between the amount of the  benefit increase and the birthrate among welfare recipients," said Fairlie.

The so-called "family cap" policy is one of the most hotly debated  topics of welfare reform. Historically, all states provided increased  monetary benefits to women who have additional children while receiving  Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), the program recently  replaced by Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF). Many states  have recently adopted "family caps," which eliminate those extra monetary  benefits.

Fairlie and London's findings parallel a preliminary report by the state  of New Jersey on its welfare reform efforts, which include a family cap that  was implemented in 1992. Although the birth rate among women  participating in a state-supported evaluation dropped from 11 percent in  1991 to 6 percent during the second year of the family cap, researchers  concluded that "the significant drop in New Jersey's welfare birth rate could  not be directly linked to the 'family cap.'" A similar decline in birthrates  was evident among a control group of welfare recipients who continued to  receive a grant increase with the birth of another child.

"Following on the heels of New Jersey's announcement, this study  provides further evidence suggesting that it's quite likely that states that  impose a family cap won't see a big drop in fertility," said Fairlie. "There  doesn't seem to be a strong relationship between out-of-wedlock birthrates  among welfare recipients and the additional monthly benefits they receive  following the birth of each child."

Fairlie and London's study examined data from the U.S. Bureau of the  Census gathered from 1990 to 1992. The data, part of the 1990 Panel of the  Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), provides detailed  information on income levels and all forms of government assistance  received by respondents. Fairlie and London did a state-by-state examination  of benefits provided per number of children in search of a correlation  between states that offer larger benefit increases and higher birthrates  among welfare mothers.

"The only correlation we found was statistically insignificant," said  Fairlie. "And the correlation disappeared once we included women with  children who were not receiving welfare as a control group in our analysis."  During the study, benefit increases for women who had a second child while  receiving AFDC ranged from $24/month in Mississippi to $134/month in  California.

Of about 15,000 women surveyed for more than two years during the  SIPP data-collection process, about 1,000 were welfare recipients. "1990  was the first year that the Bureau of the Census deliberately focused on  gathering information about female-headed households in the SIPP, so we  had a relatively rich sample to pull from," said Fairlie, adding that he and  London did numerous sensitivity checks to make sure their findings were  holding up.

Results were similar among whites, African Americans, and never- married women, said Fairlie. Less consistent results were found among  Hispanics and divorced or separated women, but the sample sizes among  those groups were very small, said Fairlie.
