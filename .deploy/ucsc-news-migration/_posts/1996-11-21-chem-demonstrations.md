title: Chemistry Demonstrations Galvanize Kids At Children's Discovery Museum

Cliff Harris, Ph.D. candidate in chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz, calls himself "The Kid's Chemist." That nickname is  well deserved, Harris proved recently, as he held hundreds of kids in  thrall with chemistry demonstrations at the Children's Discovery  Museum in San Jose.

Harris conducted his innovative, funny, and visually striking  educational programs for several groups of children on November 13  and November 21. The visitors, on class field trips at the museum,  ranged in age from preschoolers to third graders. Harris and his  assistant Jason Camara, a senior in chemistry, set out to capture  the imaginations of their young audiences--and to spark some  positive feelings about chemistry along the way. Judging from the  rapt attention and piercing squeals of the kids, the UCSC team  succeeded.

"The physical sciences are pretty much ignored in elementary  school," Harris says. "I'm really concerned that we should broaden  our children's views of science, especially in chemistry, which plays  such an important role in our everyday lives. Unfortunately, many  kids are turned off by negative news about chemistry and by  teachers who don't have the backgrounds to present it in an engaging  way."

Harris's experiments, conducted with high energy and slapstick  humor, included the "glowing pickle" (electricity and light), "rainbow  flames" (combustion of different elements), and "chemical races"  (rates of chemical reactions). A highlight was the ever-popular  liquid nitrogen segment, in which Harris flash-froze a balloon,  racquetball, and other objects in liquid nitrogen and then shattered  them into tiny bits.

This sort of outreach is not new to Harris, who has volunteered  countless hours in recent years to visiting elementary school  classes in the Santa Cruz area. His initial motivation for doing so  was to enliven science education for his own daughter, now nine  years old.

The museum programs are just one example of a burgeoning  effort across many disciplines at UCSC to help improve K-12 science  education in the region. Another thriving example also hails from the  Chemistry and Biochemistry Department: Science Teaching Fellows.  Via this program, UCSC science undergraduates work with faculty  and graduate students to develop experiments to perform at  elementary and middle schools in the area. Each fellow visits two or  three classrooms during the quarter-long program. For more  information, visit the program's World Wide Web site:  <http://www.chemistry.ucsc.edu/Projects/STF>

Dalia Brown of the Children's Discovery Museum arranged  Harris's programs to help promote basic interest and curiosity about  chemistry in young children. "Cliff's unique talent is making this  material accessible to all age ranges," Brown says. "They are  absolutely riveted by his demonstrations." Brown made the  connection with Harris because her father-in-law was the  postdoctoral supervisor of Bakthan Singaram, associate professor of  chemistry and biochemistry at UCSC and Harris's thesis adviser.

Harris will earn his Ph.D. from UCSC in June and plans to teach  chemistry at the college level. His research has focused on nontoxic  and low-cost methods of producing important medicinal compounds.
