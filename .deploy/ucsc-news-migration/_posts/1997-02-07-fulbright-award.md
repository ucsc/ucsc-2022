SANTA CRUZ, CA--In recognition of his academic achievement and his  community work, John Brown Childs, professor of sociology at UC Santa  Cruz, has received the prestigious Fulbright Thomas Jefferson Chair award  for 1997-98.

Childs, an expert on contemporary urban issues, will spend a portion of  the 1997-98 academic year at the University of Amsterdam in the  Netherlands. As a visiting scholar, Childs will be an "academic ambassador"  to universities and community organizations in the Netherlands, lecturing  about issues of urban community and the state of race and ethnic relations  in the United States.

The Fulbright Program is an international educational exchange  program administered by the United States government. Grants are awarded  to U.S. students, teachers, and scholars to study, teach, lecture, and conduct  research abroad. Grants are also given to foreign nationals to engage in  similar activities in the United States. Administered by the Fulbright  Program, the Thomas Jefferson Chair is awarded to an individual each year  with "impressive academic achievement" in both teaching and research.

Childs is a popular teacher whose research on social action and  populist social movements is enriched by his volunteer participation in  community groups. He has been involved for many years in the urban youth  antiviolence movement in the U.S. He is a member of the board of directors  of Barrios Unidos/United Neighborhoods, a Santa Cruz-based national  organization that is dedicated to creating peaceful alternatives to gang and  youth violence. Childs also works with Stop the Violence in Los Angeles and  the Institute for Violence Reduction in Hartford, Connecticut.

"There are about 6,000 antiviolence organizations in the U.S. today, and  what we're seeing is really a community renaissance--a rebuilding of our  urban areas," says Childs. "I believe this emergence of constructive  leadership opportunities for youth has positioned us to create a positive  society in the 21st century, and it's because of what's going on in the  ghettos and in the barrios."

Many young people in urban areas face a range of problems from  violence at home or on the streets, to family, drug, or school problems, says  Childs. Barrios Unidos, which has 34 chapters across the country, offers a  multidimensional program that combines job training, leadership skills, and  education with spiritual values that stem from Native American  sensibilities, he says.

"It's pragmatic and also very visionary," Childs says of the Barrios  Unidos program. "The emphasis is on youth leadership--most of the directors  are under 25 years old. In order to do this work, you have to have been there,  and these young people have. They've not only ignored society's message that  they can't make it, they've done the opposite. They've made it and are helping  thousands of other young people make it. It's tremendously uplifting."

Childs is author of Leadership, Conflict, and Cooperation in Afro- American Social Thought (Temple University Press) and coeditor of Global  Visions: Beyond the New World Order (South End Press). He has written  numerous articles, including the recent "Peace in the Streets: The New Youth  Peace Movement," which appeared in Z magazine. He is currently writing a  book entitled "Transcommunality: Roots of Peace and Justice in the Age of  Crisis."

The Fulbright Program was established in 1946 to increase mutual  understanding between the people of the United States and the people of  other countries through educational and cultural exchanges. Approximately  4,800 new grants are awarded annually.
