SANTA CRUZ, CA--Bored by the election? Wondering what's at stake? A panel  of faculty experts from the University of California, Santa Cruz, will  discuss it all at a free public forum on Wednesday, October 30, from 7 to 9  P.M. The event, which is handicapped accessible, will be held in the  Stevenson College Dining Hall on the UCSC campus.

"The national press has declared the presidential election the most  boring race in recent memory, and 50 percent of Americans say they've lost  interest in the election," says Michael Brown, an associate professor of  politics at UCSC. "But isn't there a lot at stake in this election? That's what  we'll be talking about."

Other discussion topics will include:
* Does this election mean conservative ideas have triumphed  regardless of the outcome and will dominate American politics for the  conceivable future?
* Will Newt Gingrich and the Republicans retain control of Congress?  Does it matter if they do?
* What about state and local politics? Do they offer an alternative to  national politics?
* Will Proposition 209, the initiative that would repeal affirmative  action in California, pass, and what might happen if it does?
* What about the many other propositions on the ballot in California  this year, including laws that would affect health care, campaign financing,  and local taxes?
