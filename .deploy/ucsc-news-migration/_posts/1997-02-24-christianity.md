**Interdisciplinary, Intercampus Project Receives $300,000 Grant From Pew Charitable Trust**

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Following Spanish invasions in the 16th through 18th  centuries, Christianity emerged as a dominant religion in South America.  The general assumption has been that Spanish missionaries brought the  religion to natives who then adopted it in place of their own religious  beliefs. But three professors from three different universities are  collaborating on a research project that offers a different perspective-- that Christianity often took hold and evolved not through the work of  Christian missionaries but because it was taken up and reinvented by the  "indigenous elite," the native nobility.

The project, "Indigenous Elites and Christian Identity: Mediating Mind,  Body, Spirit in Mid-Colonial Peru," just received a $300,000 three-year  grant from the Pew Charitable Trust. Lead researchers on the project are  Carolyn Dean, assistant professor of art history at the University of  California, Santa Cruz; Kathryn Burns, assistant professor of history at the  University of Florida; and Jean-Jacques Decoster, professor-investigator of  anthropology at the Facultad Latinoamericana De Ciencias Sociales in Quito,  Ecuador.

Their research will focus on the Andean regions of Peru and Ecuador,  populated by, among other indigenous groups, the Inca. "Andean elites were  crucial in the history of Christianity in this area," said Dean. "From our  perspective the Andeans take center stage in the process of Christian  conversion as opposed to the Spanish. That enables us to shift away from the  view of Spanish missionaries as the active evangelizers and natives as the  passive recipients of a set of beliefs. "

Each professor will look at this premise from their particular  academic perspective. Dean, who is focusing on visual representations,  notes that there is an abundance of imagery from the High Colonial era that  refers to Andean Christian religious practices in great detail. "The nobility  of the region literally documented their participation in Christian festivals,  often in oil paintings on canvas. There are representations of Inca and other  ethnic leaders participating in Christian ritual performances, such as  Corpus Christi. You see in these paintings that traditional western Christian  symbols and icons are used right alongside traditional Andean religious  symbols and icons. Andean symbols are made relevant in the Christian world  of colonial Peru, and it is the Andeans themselves who assert their  relevance."

Another essential component of the project will be archival work,  mostly of very old and fragile government records--some more than 400  years old. As part of her research last summer, Dean was reading through  some of these documents--indigenous wills dating as far back as 1680.  "Every time you turn the page of a 16th-century document," she observes,  "bits of the paper break off." Right now, researchers must turn through each  delicate leaf of each record book to find what they are looking for. Once the  records are indexed, researchers can turn directly to the page they want,  saving wear and tear on the fragile documents.

As part of the project, the collaborators will host an international  symposium and write a book on their subject.

The project is being administered by the Center of Latin American  Studies at the University of Florida.
