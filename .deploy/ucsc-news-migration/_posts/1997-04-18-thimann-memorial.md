SANTA CRUZ, CA--Friends of the late Kenneth V. Thimann will  celebrate his life and his contributions to the University of  California, Santa Cruz, at a memorial service on Saturday, May 3. The  service, which is open to the public, will begin at 1:30 p.m. in the  Crown College Dining Hall at UCSC. A reception, also open to the  public, will follow immediately in the Crown College courtyard.

A noted botanist, Thimann died peacefully at his home in  Haverford, PA, on January 15. He was 92. Family members held a  private memorial service for him in Haverford on January 19.

Speakers at the May 3 service will recall Thimann's role in  shaping UCSC's early history. Founding chancellor Dean McHenry  recruited Thimann from Harvard University in 1965 as professor of  biology and the first provost of Crown College. Upon his retirement  as provost in 1972, campus officials renamed UCSC's first biology  research facility--Thimann Laboratories--in his honor. Thimann  remained active in research and university affairs until moving to  Haverford in 1989.

Among his many lasting imprints on the campus, Thimann  helped to nurture the UCSC Arboretum into an internationally known  horticultural site. He also was an accomplished amateur pianist and  founded the Crown Chamber Players with his wife, Ann Mary  Bateman Thimann, who died in 1987.

Scientific colleagues will describe the remarkable impact of  Thimann's research, which spanned a career of more than five  decades. His pioneering work in plant physiology earned him the  prestigious Balzan Prize in 1982, awarded yearly in areas not  covered by the Nobel Prizes. He also was a member of the National  Academy of Sciences and numerous international scientific  societies.

Speakers will include Chancellor Emeritus Dean McHenry;  Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood; Leo Laporte, provost of Crown College;  Ray Collett, director of the UCSC Arboretum; several professors  from UCSC, Stanford University, and San Francisco State University;  and members of the Thimann family. Musicians will perform a 1950  piano composition by Thimann, written to accompany the words of a  favorite poem, "The Nightingale Near the House."
