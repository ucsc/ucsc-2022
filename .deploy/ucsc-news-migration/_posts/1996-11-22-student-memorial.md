SANTA CRUZ, CA--Family, friends, and academic colleagues of UC  Santa Cruz graduate student Mei Wang, who died today (November 22)  from injuries suffered in a car accident, will hold a memorial  service for her at 2 p.m. Sunday, November 24, at the Cowell College  Provost's House on the UCSC campus. The service is open to all who  wish to remember Wang.

Wang's family arrived from China today to be with her in her  final moments at Dominican Santa Cruz Hospital.

The accident occurred on Highway 17 on Monday morning,  November 18, as Wang was returning to Santa Cruz from San Jose  International Airport. Wang lost control of her vehicle on a wet  curve and spun into oncoming traffic. She never regained  consciousness.

A native of China, Wang was in the final stages of course work  for her master's degree in computer engineering. UCSC Executive  Vice Chancellor Michael Tanner awarded Wang her degree at the  hospital on Wednesday in the presence of her husband, Yong Duan of  Portland, Oregon.

Wang, age 30, earned a master's degree in philosophy from  SiChuan University in China before coming to UCSC. She was planning  to join her husband in Portland after she completed her degree  requirements.

In addition to her husband, Wang is survived by her parents,  Guanghuai Wang and Mingzhu Xu, and her sister, Jing Wang, all of  China.
