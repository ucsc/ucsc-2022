## Body Image Is The Focus Of Events At The UCSC Women's Center

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Body image is the focus of four events planned this month by the Women's Center at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The events are being presented as part of Bodyfest: Loving Ourselves Regardless! to coincide with National Eating Disorders Week, which is February 22-26. "Women have so many issues around eating and body image that we decided to present a host of events that explore these issues from multiple viewpoints," explained Shane Snowdon, director of the UCSC Women's Center. "Most importantly, we wanted to introduce an element of celebration to the discussion of women's bodies." All events are free and open to the public. For more information about any of the events listed below, call the UCSC Women's Center at (831) 459-2291.
