SANTA CRUZ, CA-In honor of its 20-year reunion, the class of '78 at the University of California, Santa Cruz, has donated $40,712 toward a scholarship program for students with financial need. It is the largest gift ever made by a UC Santa Cruz alumni class.

Kevin James, a member of the class, presented the check to Steven Jung, president of the UCSC Alumni Association, at the class's 20-year reunion dinner on April 18. The dinner took place in the dining hall of Merrill College during UCSC's annual Banana Slug Spring Fair celebration.

While presenting the gift on behalf of his classmates, James emphasized the importance of all gifts. "Not everyone can make a large contribution, but what matters most is that people have participated as donors by giving what they can," he said. "It has been a group effort."

The $40,000 gift adds to the UCSC Alumni Association Scholarship Fund, which provides support to students who have financial need, said Daniel G. Aldrich III, assistant chancellor for University Advancement at UCSC. The fund awarded ten $2,500 scholarships this academic year.

The gift brings the scholarship fund to more than $400,000, and almost halfway to the Alumni Association's goal of establishing a permanent endowment of $1 million.

Class gifts to provide current scholarships or build endowments have been a tradition since UCSC began hosting 20-year reunions six years ago. This year's gift effort was organized by the Development Committee of the Alumni Association Council, the 20th Reunion Gift Committee, and the Office of Annual and Special Gifts.
