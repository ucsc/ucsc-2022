SANTA CRUZ, CA--Several UC Santa Cruz students pursuing research  about California's striking and oft-imperiled flora and fauna  benefited during the last academic year from awards granted by the  UC Natural Reserve System.

Research projects funded in part by the Natural Reserve  System ranged from studies of the physiology of elephant seals to  the genetics of inbred animal species, such as condors. Grants also  helped faculty members finance class trips to some of the reserves  for intensive undergraduate field training.

Established by the UC Regents in 1965, the Natural Reserve  System now encompasses 32 sites that represent a relatively  pristine cross section of the state's diverse natural habitats. Each  site is preserved for university-level teaching and research and is  protected from most public access.

Researchers at UCSC oversee three of the reserves: Año Nuevo  Island Reserve, a breeding ground for numerous marine mammals and  seabirds between Santa Cruz and Half Moon Bay; Landels-Hill Big  Creek Reserve, a 4,000-acre swath of the Big Sur coast featuring an  unspoiled watershed, conifer and hardwood forests, grassland,  chaparral, and abundant wildlife; and Younger Lagoon Reserve, a 20- acre lagoon, beach, and coastal bluff adjacent to UCSC's Long Marine  Lab on the west side of Santa Cruz.

Grants for the recently completed 1995-96 academic year  went to the following students and researchers:

Mildred E. Mathias Graduate Research Awards, $2,000: Dorian  Houser, Suzanne Kohin, and Sanjayan Muttulingam, all graduate  students in biology.

Robert M. Norris Undergraduate Research Award, $1,000: Devon  Pearse, senior in biology.

Undergraduate Course Travel Awards, $1,000 to support class  trips to reserves: Giacomo Bernardi, assistant professor of biology,  and John Pearse, professor emeritus of biology.

Undergraduate Independent Study Travel Awards, $250: Alysha  Ficarra, senior in environmental studies; Karyn O'Hearn, recent  graduate in environmental studies; and Jennifer Sandstrom, former  student in biology and environmental studies.
