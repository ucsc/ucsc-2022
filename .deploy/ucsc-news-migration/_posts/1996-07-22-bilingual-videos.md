SANTA CRUZ, CA--Teachers faced with the challenge of a classroom  of students who speak different languages now have a new resource  to draw on: a series of six documentary-style videotapes produced at  the University of California, Santa Cruz, that demonstrate some of  the most effective instructional practices being used today by  teachers of linguistically and culturally diverse students.

The videotapes show real teachers at work in the classroom  and feature interviews with the teachers and other experts who  explain how and why these practices work. The videotapes are  designed for use in teacher education and professional development  programs, as well as by individual schools or school districts. The  six videotapes are:
* Profile of Effective Bilingual Teaching: Kindergarten
* Profile of Effective Bilingual Teaching: First Grade
* Profile of Effective Teaching in a Multilingual Classroom
* Instructional Conversations: Understanding Through  Discussion
* Profile of Effective Two-Way Bilingual Teaching: Sixth  Grade
* Learning Together: Two-Way Bilingual Immersion Programs

Available for purchase at $40 apiece, each tape comes with a  comprehensive manual that includes suggestions for using the video  in workshops and other training formats.

The series, which has been in development for several years,  was completed with the recent release of the last two videotapes.  The video Profile of Effective Bilingual Teaching: First Grade,  received the Silver Apple Award from the 1995 National Education  Media Network as an outstanding film in teaching and education.

The series was produced and directed by Jon Silver under the  auspices of the National Center for Research on Cultural Diversity  and Second Language Learning at UCSC. The executive producer was  Barry McLaughlin, a professor of psychology at UCSC and director of  the center. The center, which was funded by a five-year grant from  the federal Department of Education, Office of Educational Research  and Improvement, completed its work June 30, 1996.

"What's unique about these videotapes is that we focused on  instructional practices, and the experts are the teachers," says  McLaughlin. "The videotapes are designed to make the center's  research accessible. The people talking are teachers, and the voices  are those of teachers."
