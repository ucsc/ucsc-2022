SANTA CRUZ, CA--In the days following the 1989 Loma Prieta  earthquake, few subjects of a dream study recalled any of their  dreams, says psychologist Veronica Tonay. During the second week,  subjects experienced extraordinarily happy dreams full of joy and  good feelings. It wasn't until the third week that they started  dreaming of earthquakes and of being afraid.

Tonay, author of a new book about dreaming and creativity,  suspects that dreams helped quake survivors to cope with the  stress. Dreams are an important outlet for many emotions that often  go unexpressed during our waking hours, says Tonay, a lecturer in  psychology and director of the Psychology Field Study Program at  the University of California, Santa Cruz. Her book The Art of  Dreaming (Berkeley, CA: Celestial Arts, 1995), offers practical  guidance for those interested in exploring dreams as a new channel  of self-understanding.

Tonay, who has a private counseling practice in Santa Cruz, has  interpreted more than 15,000 dreams. Her book is based upon  research she performed on 3,000 dreams of 200 people. Tonay also  draws on the work of Carl Jung, Sigmund Freud, and others to  present an engrossing analysis of dreams and creativity and to offer  guidance for those eager to interpret their dreams.

Tonay lays the foundation for her exploration of creativity and  dreams by describing the similarities among dreams across cultures  and the differences between men's and women's dreams. "I want to  help readers identify what is unique about their own dreams and  avoid overinterpreting what is common dream material," says Tonay.  She urges dreamers to keep a dream journal and to study a series of  dreams--rather than individual dreams--to identify meaningful  themes, and she offers exercises and tips for assessing their  creativity, interpreting dreams, and working through creative  blocks.

In her book, Tonay defines creative people as those who  produce "original and worthwhile creative products, such as ideas,  paintings, poems, mathematical theorems, business plans, stories,  sonatas--and dreams." Emotions are important for creative  individuals because "creativity can get blocked when we are not  expressing our feelings," says Tonay. "The themes in our dreams  show us the feelings we need to address in waking life so we can  move on. For creative people, exploring dream themes can unlock  energy that fuels creative work."

In her research, Tonay compared the dreams of highly creative  people with those of less creative individuals and found that  creative people were far more likely to dream about loss,  confronting natural obstacles, and children who are endangered.

"Studies show that creative people are more likely to have  experienced loss as children, and it turns out that they also dream  more often of loss--loss of a possession or person, death, or  illness," says Tonay. "That kind of traumatic childhood experience  stays with you and can come up again and again in dreams."

The theme of obstacles appears in the form of natural barriers  like boulders, trees, or rivers that threaten or block the dreamer's  progress in the dream. "These elements often come up around work  issues, or when people feel stuck, like writers who write  themselves into a corner," says Tonay.

Tonay describes a writer who was facing a creative block and  had a series of frightening dreams of encountering boulders blocking  his path: First, he veered his car off a cliff to avoid the boulder; in  another, it took days to drive around the boulder; and in the last  dream, he rented a backhoe to chip away at it. The dreams showed  the man his fear of failure and helped him realize that his way of  coping with his anxiety about running out of ideas was to avoid  writing, says Tonay. Ultimately, he resolved that in order to get  beyond the block he needed to continually chip away at it and write  every day, even if he felt hopeless.

Dreams about endangered children may reflect the dreamer's  emotional experience of being a child in danger, says Tonay. "The  themes that pop up in our dreams offer signposts for getting past  where we're blocked," she says. "They reflect the depth of our  emotions and mirror our struggles. And in addition to showing us our  characteristic ways of dealing with challenges, they illustrate new  solutions."

"Dreams are especially important right now because we've  become such an overly rational culture," says Tonay. "Anything  irrational or emotional is held suspect. It's important to be rational,  but the balance has tipped--there's too much rationality and too  little genuine feeling in our culture today."

For those who rarely remember their dreams, Tonay offers  encouragement. Her research has shown that there are no personality  characteristics that explain why some people remember their  dreams and others do not. "You really just have to have an interest,  and once you start paying attention, recall increases," says Tonay.
