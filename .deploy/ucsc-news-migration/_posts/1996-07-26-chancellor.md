SANTA CRUZ, CA--President Clinton has nominated Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood of the University of California, Santa Cruz, to a  six-year term on the National Science Board, the White House  announced today. The U.S. Senate must approve Clinton's nomination  of Greenwood and four other candidates.

The 24-member National Science Board recommends overall  national policies for promoting basic research and education in the  sciences. Board members, drawn from industry and universities,  represent a variety of science and engineering disciplines. They are  selected for their distinguished contributions to research,  education, or public service.

"M.R.C. Greenwood will bring to the National Science Board a  unique understanding of the importance of furthering alliances  between government, private industry, and the nation's research  universities in the advancement of science," says UC President  Richard C. Atkinson. "The nation will be well served by this  appointment.

"Chancellor Greenwood's nomination demonstrates the high  national esteem in which the University of California researchers  and its campuses are held, and it is fitting evidence of the  contribution UC Santa Cruz has made toward enhancing that  reputation," Atkinson continued.

Greenwood, an expert in the fields of physiology and nutrition,  became UCSC's seventh chancellor on July 1. If approved, her  position on the National Science Board will provide a natural segue  from a previous federal post: Greenwood served as associate  director for science in the White House Office of Science and  Technology Policy from November 1993 to May 1995. There, she  advised the Clinton administration on issues related to national  budgetary priorities and federal investment in fundamental  scientific research.

"I'm extremely pleased that the president has nominated me to  the historic National Science Board," Greenwood says. "Not since the  Sputnik era has there been a more important time for scientific  discovery and improved scientific education in this country. As we  look toward a 21st century characterized by the production of  knowledge, the transmission of knowledge, and the ability to access  knowledge, scientists, particularly those in universities, will play a  pivotal role in our economy, our quality of life, and our international  competitiveness."

Greenwood was dean of graduate studies and vice provost for  academic outreach at UC Davis from 1989 through June 1996, taking  a leave of absence for the White House position. Her prior academic  affiliations include Columbia University and Vassar College. She  received her B.A. in biology from Vassar College, summa cum laude,  and her Ph.D. in physiology, developmental biology, and neurosciences  from Rockefeller University. In 1992, she was elected to the  Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences.

President Clinton also announced the following nominees to  the National Science Board:
* John A. Armstrong, former vice president of science and  technology and member of the Corporate Management Board at IBM.
* Stanley Vincent Jaskolski, chief technical officer and vice  president of technical management for the Eaton Corporation,  Cleveland.
* Vera C. Rubin, research astronomer at the Carnegie  Institution of Washington, D.C., and chair of the section on  astronomy of the National Academy of Sciences.
* Bob H. Suzuki, an aeronautical and mechanical engineer and  president of California State Polytechnic University, Pomona.

The president appoints eight members to the National Science  Board every two years. The board was established by the National  Science Foundation Act of 1950.
