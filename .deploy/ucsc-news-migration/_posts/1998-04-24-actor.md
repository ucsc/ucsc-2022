SANTA CRUZ, CA--Danny Scheie, assistant professor of theater arts at the University of California, Santa Cruz, won the Best Actor Award from the Bay Area Critics Circle for his performance in The Last Hairdresser. The award was presented April 6 in a ceremony held at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco.

Scheie played the role of Guy Voss in the Douglas Holsclaw play, which ran last November and December at the Theatre Rhinoceros in San Francisco. Scheie both acted in and directed the play and also earned a best director nomination for his work on the play. The awards are presented annually for performances in the San Francisco Bay Area; recipients are selected by Bay Area theater critics.

Among the comments made by critics are the following:

"Danny Scheie's production is so sharp and snappy that you marvel at how well his directorial sensibilities match the playwright's comic genius." \-- Robert Hurwitt, San Francisco Examiner

"The two stand-out stars of this production are Holsclaw's clever script and Danny Scheie's Guy Voss." \--Heidi Beeler, Bay Area Reporter

"Doug Holsclaw's ambitious piece about the making and unmaking of a vicious queen is part memory, part screwball comedy, and part seriously tacky musical. . . . the hilarity is real and director-star Danny Scheie's carefully calibrated comic turn is worth the trip." \-- Octavio Roca, San Francisco Chronicle
