title: Study Unveils A Way To Probe Fault Zones Before An Earthquake Hits

SANTA CRUZ, CA--A new technique may let seismologists estimate  which parts of a fault are likely to rupture most severely during an  earthquake, even if the fault hasn't broken for a century or more.

The technique relies upon an apparent connection between the  pre-earthquake geology of a fault zone and the amount of motion  that a quake triggers along different segments of the fault. A  similar relationship exists between fault-zone geology and the  pattern of aftershocks that strike after the main earthquake.

Seismologist Justin Revenaugh of the University of California,  Santa Cruz, who devised the method, says it cannot predict when an  earthquake will happen or how large it will be. However, the method  may help researchers refine their maps of seismic hazard by hinting  in advance which fault segments will pack the biggest wallop. That  information could prove especially useful for the many mysteriously  "locked" segments in southern California and elsewhere.

"It's difficult to figure out how much slip might occur on  locked faults," says Revenaugh, a member of the UC Santa Cruz  Institute of Tectonics. "This scheme begins to give us a rational way  of looking at each fault and dividing it up into segments. Those  segments are the building blocks that could break in one large  earthquake or several smaller ones."

Revenaugh bases his conclusions on an analysis of the  magnitude 7.3 Landers temblor and two other sizable quakes that  ripped across California's Mojave Desert region in 1992. His study  appears in the November 24 issue of the journal Science.

Revenaugh adapted a technique used by researchers to monitor  nuclear tests. Effectively, waves from earthquakes can serve as  sonar-like "pings" to probe the earth's crust. Revenaugh's method  models the rocks within the crust as a swarm of points that scatter  energy, like fish in the water scatter sonar. Quakes from across the  globe send waves through the swarm. Seismographs receive the  echoes; their intensity and timing tells Revenaugh which points  scatter the energy most strongly. Pronounced scattering exposes an  abrupt change in the earth's structure, such as a dense network of  cracks along a fault.

For his latest work, Revenaugh drew upon detailed recordings  of 81 earthquakes around the Pacific Rim between 1982 and 1992.  The quakes were big enough to rattle dozens of stations in the  Southern California Seismic Network. Revenaugh scoured the records  for a special type of seismic echo, reflecting sudden changes in  geologic properties about three to ten miles underground.

His study focused on a patch of land around the Landers fault  zone, which knifed a 50-mile scar across the Mojave Desert on June  28, 1992. The study area also encompassed a magnitude 6.1  foreshock ("Joshua Tree" earthquake), a magnitude 6.2 aftershock  ("Big Bear" earthquake), and thousands of smaller aftershocks.  Revenaugh used seismic scattering to illuminate patterns in the  geology of the three fault zones in the decade prior to the quakes,  then checked to see whether those patterns somehow were evident  in the quakes themselves.

He found several convincing ties. Most notably, he linked the  degree of pre-earthquake scattering to two measurements: the  amount of motion on the faults during the quakes and the pattern of  aftershocks in the months that followed. Extreme transitions in  seismic scattering--from low scattering to high or vice versa  within short stretches of a fault--usually pointed to areas where  the fault moved most severely and where aftershocks clustered  most tightly.

Based on differences in the way the seismic waves "lit up" the  fault zones, Revenaugh concluded that the scattering must come  from clusters of cracks or other imperfections that align in the  direction of each fault. The research did not reveal what might cause  such flaws in the rock. However, Revenaugh thinks they are related  to stresses that build up to different degrees along each segment of  a fault before an earthquake occurs.

"If I had published this paper in early 1992," he says, "I  couldn't have told you when these earthquakes would happen or how  big they would be. But I could have told you how the faults were  segmented and where the most and least slip would occur." For  Landers in particular, Revenaugh states, "This would have pinpointed  fault segments which, before 1992, we could only guess at."

Revenaugh now is extending his technique to other fault zones  in southern California. He is checking his approach against existing  seismic records and will try to apply it to poorly understood areas.  He notes that the method will not unravel the tectonic complexities  of the Los Angeles Basin, because most faults there rupture in a  different way and are too close together for the method to resolve.  But he feels confident it will shed light on locked segments of major  strike-slip faults--such as a long stretch of the San Andreas from  Cholame to San Bernardino, which unleashed a huge earthquake  (bigger than magnitude 8) in 1857 but hasn't budged since.

Revenaugh will present early results from these studies at a  poster session on December 14 at a meeting of the American  Geophysical Union in San Francisco.
