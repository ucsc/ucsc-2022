SANTA CRUZ, CA--Principal Planner Graham Bice of UC Santa Cruz  has earned certification as a member of the American Institute of  Certified Planners (AICP). Bice was one of 738 planners certified  this year out of 1,021 exam registrants. About 9,500 planners now  hold AICP certification nationwide.

Bice, a planner at UCSC since 1982, played a central role in  developing UCSC's 1988 Long Range Development Plan (LRDP), a  blueprint for careful campus growth, as well as the more recent  LRDP Implementation Program. He now oversees work on a master  plan for UCSC's Monterey Bay Education, Science, and Technology  (MBEST) Center at the former Fort Ord military base.

Bice received a double B.A. in environmental planning and  economics from UCSC in 1977 and a master's degree in regional  planning from Cornell University in 1980. He is a resident of  Watsonville.

AICP, the professional institute within the American Planning  Association, certifies practicing city, regional, urban, and rural  planners and promotes continuing education and professional  development. Certification requires specific education, experience,  and a passing performance on a rigorous planning examination.

"I strongly support the ethical standards and high expectations  that go with AICP certification," Bice says, "and I encourage all  practicing planners to seek certification."
