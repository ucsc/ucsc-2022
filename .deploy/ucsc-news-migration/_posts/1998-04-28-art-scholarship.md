SANTA CRUZ--Twelve students at the University of California, Santa Cruz, have been selected to receive the William Hyde Irwin and Susan Benteen Irwin Scholarships, given annually to outstanding young artists. The students' work will be exhibited on campus from Friday, May 8, through Saturday, June 6 in the Sesnon Art Gallery. A reception will be held on Wednesday, May 20, from 5 to 7 p.m. The reception is free and open to the public.

The Irwin scholarship fund was established in 1986 through a gift from Mrs. Irwin in memory of her late husband, an artist and writer. When she died in 1990 the endowment totaled $500,000, which provides $2,500 scholarships annually to up to 13 students in visual arts. Students are nominated and selected by UCSC art faculty, and scholarships are awarded on the basis of merit and need.

The 1997-98 recipients are: Deric Carner, Bradley Fulton, Laura Green, Kari Jewell, Jason Kolb, Katy Krantz, Stephanie Prussin, Aviva Rochester, Lisa Rodasta, Roger Uhl, Mark Whiteley, and Cindy Yep. Faculty sponsors are associate professor of art Norman Locks and professor of art Doyle Foreman.

The Sesnon Art Gallery is open Tuesday through Sunday from noon to 5 p.m. For gallery information, call (408) 459-2314.
