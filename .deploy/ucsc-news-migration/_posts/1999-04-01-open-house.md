SANTA CRUZ, CA-The University of California, Santa Cruz, will host the Banana Slug Spring Fair on Saturday, April 17. Current and prospective students and their families, UCSC alumni, and all other friends of the campus are invited to the annual celebration, which features information booths, presentations, artistic performances, facility tours, and alumni reunions. The campus open house begins at 9 A.M. Last year's Banana Slug Spring Fair drew nearly 5,000 people to the campus.

Tours will take place at the arts facilities, UCSC's eight individual colleges, Long Marine Laboratory, the Alan Chadwick Garden, and the East Field House physical education center. Visitors may also purchase a barbecue lunch at several sites on campus.

At this year's fair, UCSC will celebrate its first 30-year reunion. UCSC's "pioneer class," who attended the campus when it first opened in 1965, will celebrate throughout the weekend. Other reunions include a luncheon for all alumni, with special recognition to classes celebrating 5- to 30-year reunions; a Chemistry and Biochemistry Department afternoon lecture on "Membranes, Martians, and Meteorites" and reunion dinner later that day; and at Oakes College, a special reception for its Class of '79 and a presentation about the Oakes Mentor Program.

Other events include "The Writing Life/Life on the Page" conference, beginning Friday night, which will feature prominent and emerging alumni writers of fiction, nonfiction, and poetry, and UCSC literature and writing faculty; receptions at various campus resource centers; workshops on financial aid as well as using the World Wide Web; college receptions; a Chicano/Latino cultural performance; a celebration of Asian/Pacific Rim performing arts; and a nature walk.

On Sunday, April 18, a brunch for UCSC alumni at the Santa Cruz Hillel center is also planned to celebrate Hillel's one-year anniversary at its new location near campus.
