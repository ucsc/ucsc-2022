SANTA CRUZ, CA--Three Russian political scientists will discuss  the upcoming Russian presidential elections, and their comments  will be followed by a response from three political scientists at the  University of California, Santa Cruz, during a free public forum on  Monday, May 6. The forum, "Presidential Elections: Russia and  America," will be held from 2 to 5 p.m. in the Silverman Conference  Room at Stevenson College on the UC Santa Cruz campus.

Participating in the discussion about the Russian presidential  elections, which begin June 16, will be:
* Vyacheslav Igrunov, director of the Institute for Humanities  and Political Studies in Moscow and a member of Russia's Duma (like  the U.S. Congress). Igrunov is also a top aide to democratic  presidential candidate Grigorii Yavlinskii.
* Liliya Shevtsova, program director with the Carnegie  Foundation in Moscow and a commentator on Russian politics in the  Russian media. Shevtsova has also taught at UC Berkeley and Johns  Hopkins University.
* Aleksander Tsipko, a political scientist with the Gorbachev  Foundation in Moscow.

The panelists will discuss the expected outcome and the  significance of the election. Then, responding to the remarks of their  peers, three UCSC faculty members who specialize in American  politics will comment on what bearing the Russian election may  have on the U.S. presidential race, and they will discuss how  different outcomes might affect relations between the two  countries. UCSC participants will be:
* Daniel Wirls, associate professor of politics who  specializes in the presidency, Congress, and elections.
* Michael Brown, associate professor of politics and an  expert on public policy. Brown studies social policy, poverty, and  politics of the welfare state.
* Gwendolyn Mink, professor of politics whose expertise  encompasses issues of gender, race, and social policy. She also  studies racism, labor history, and women and politics.

The event is being sponsored by Stevenson College and the  Adlai E. Stevenson Program on Global Security.
