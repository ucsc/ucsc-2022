SANTA CRUZ, CA­UC Santa Cruz alumna Laurie Garrett, a science and  medical reporter for Newsday, was one of 13 journalists awarded a  prestigious Polk Award for 1997. The awards were announced in  March and will be formally presented on April 15 in New York City.

Garrett won the foreign reporting award for her 25-part series  on tuberculosis and AIDS in Russia and other countries of the former  Soviet Union. The Polk Award comes on the heels of Garrett's 1996  Pulitzer Prize for explanatory journalism for her reporting on the  Ebola virus outbreak in Zaire.

Garrett earned a B.A. in biology at UCSC in 1975 and spent  eight years as a science correspondent at National Public Radio. She  has worked at Newsday since 1988. In February 1996, she received  the Alumni Achievement Award from UCSC's Alumni Association in  recognition of her career accomplishments.

The Polk Awards, administered by Long Island University,  recognize excellence in reporting and are among the most valued  honors in journalism. They were established in 1949 in memory of  CBS news correspondent George Polk, who was killed while covering  the Greek Civil War.
