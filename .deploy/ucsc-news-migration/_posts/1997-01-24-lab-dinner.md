SANTA CRUZ, CA--Chefs from some of the area's finest restaurants  will donate their services on Sunday evening, February 2, for the  Friends of Long Marine Laboratory Gourmet Dinner. This annual  culinary extravaganza raises money for Long Marine Lab's public  education programs, including the popular "Window to Discovery";  emergency marine-mammal care; research awards for UC Santa Cruz  students; and a new Visitor Education Center at Long Marine Lab.

As it has for several years, the Hollins House Restaurant will  host the dinner. Last year's event raised about $10,000 for the  Friends of Long Marine Lab, thanks to $125 contributions from each  of the 86 guests who attended.

"The Hollins House Restaurant at Pasatiempo Golf Club has a  great deal of interest and enthusiasm to support activities for the  community of Santa Cruz," says Rick Forney, general manager at  Pasatiempo. "We are pleased to open our room with a view to host  the annual gourmet dinner of the Friends of Long Marine Laboratory."

Preparing the exquisite cuisine for the event will be chefs Jeff  Huff and Steve Rice of Hollins House, Dwight Collins of Sanderlings  at Seascape Resort, Bill Collier of Theo's, Eric Conover of  Shadowbrook, and Tracy and Pat Gentry and Terry Teplitzky of  Michael's Catering. Highlights will include an appetizer of lobster  sausage and seared ahi; an appetizer of duck confit, blackened pear  and strawberry vinaigrette with arugula, endive, and frusee; an  entree of venison osso bucco with roasted beet and wild mushrooms;  and desserts of petite coconut brulee on macaroon, candied kumquat- chocolate pave, and hazelnut-fennel torte.

Donations of goods and services from several other groups will  make the evening possible, including: wines from Monterey Bay Wine,  Young's Market, and Alexia Moore Wines; flowers from The Flower  Ladies; music performed by the Tim Wallace Band; volunteer staff  from Hollins House, Shadowbrook, and Theo's; tuxedos from Four  Seasons Bridal; and food for the volunteers from Pasatiempo golf pro  Shawn McEntee and his brother, Miles McEntee, of High 5 Pizza.
