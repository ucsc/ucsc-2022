title: Symposium On The Foundations Of Newtonian Scholarship To Be Held In London

SANTA CRUZ, CA--Arguably one of the most influential books ever  written, Isaac Newton's Principia stands as the foundation for much  of modern science. Yet, with the release of editions of Newton's  other papers and letters, scholars are finding that there is still  more to learn from and about the 300-year-old book.

A symposium on these latest insights, jointly sponsored by the  Royal Society and the History of Science Society (U.S.), will be held  at the Royal Society, 6 Carlton House Terrace, London, on Friday,  March 21. Distinguished scholars from both the humanities and the  sciences will speak at the daylong discussion. The meeting is being  organized by physicists J. Bruce Brackenridge of Lawrence  University, Richard H. Dalitz of Oxford University, and Michael  Nauenberg of the University of California, Santa Cruz.

Newton was the first to demonstrate that one could  mathematically predict the future of a physical system, in essence  initiating science as we know it today. Indeed, author John Simmons  ranked Newton first in his 1996 book, The Scientific 100: A Ranking  of the Most Influential Scientists, Past and Present. But while much  has been written on Newton and his work since his death in 1727,  how he arrived at his conclusions remains clouded. "We really don't  know much," says Nauenberg, "about how he developed his ideas."

The publication of Newton's correspondence, his mathematical  papers, and a variorum edition of the Principia, however, has kindled  a new comprehension of his work. The volumes have made accessible  the foundations of Newton's ideas, allowing more scholars to  participate in the discussion. "No longer must these items be  restricted to the few scholars who had access to the collections of  a few leading libraries," says Brackenridge.

Brackenridge, currently at the Dibner Institute for the History  of Science and Technology, and Nauenberg, a professor emeritus of  physics, have been investigating the controversy of how and when  Newton arrived at his models of planetary motion--the bedrock of  modern astronomy. "In the late 1600s," says Nauenberg, "the $64,000  question was: How did planets revolve around the sun?" A British  contemporary and rival of Newton's, Robert Hooke, had some ideas  but lacked the mathematics to implement them. After years of  fruitless contemplation, he sent some letters to Newton, asking, in  effect, for some mathematical help. Says Nauenberg, "Newton then  solved the problem, but he refused to give any credit to Hooke for his  seminal suggestions."

Nauenberg has focused his mathematics and physics expertise  on diagrams from that exchange. He has pieced together a solution to  the puzzle of how Newton developed orbital dynamics with some  crucial assistance from Hooke. He also has found that Newton  outlined in his unpublished papers several modern methods in  celestial mechanics--methods generally attributed to later great  mathematicians like Euler, Laplace, and Lagrange. This explains how  Newton obtained several important results presented--but not  derived--in his Principia.

The symposium will allow scholars to present their research  in different areas of Newton's work. It also is intended as a tribute  to those who have made Newton's documents available to all,  including Rupert Hall, coeditor of the correspondence of Isaac  Newton; D. T. Whiteside, editor of Newton's mathematical papers;  and I. B. Cohen, coeditor of the variorum edition of the Principia.

Nauenberg hopes the symposium will throw a more human light  on Newton's science. "The misunderstanding of the sciences in the  humanities has reached terrible proportions," he says. "History is the  badly needed bridge between the two."

The following talks will be presented at the symposium:
* I. Bernard Cohen, Harvard University: "Newton in Historical Perspective" 
* Alan E. Shapiro, University of Minnesota: "Newton's Experimental Investigation of Diffraction for the Optiks" 
* J. Bruce Brackenridge, Lawrence University: "Newton's Dynamics: The Diagram as a Diagnostic Device" 
* George E. Smith, Tufts University: "Fluid Resistance: Why Did Newton Change His Mind?" 
* John G. Fauvel, Open University: "Newton's Mathematical Language" 
* Alan Cook, Selwyn College: "Success and Failure in Newton's Lunar Theory" 
* Michael Nauenberg, UC Santa Cruz: "Newton's Perturbation Methods for Celestial Mechanics" 
* Curtis Wilson, St. John's College: "From Kepler to Newton: Telling the Tale" 
* A. Rupert Hall, Imperial College, London, and D. T. Whiteside,  Cambridge University, will comment and respond.
