title: Plumbing Under Midocean Ridges Called Into Question By New Study

SANTA CRUZ, CA--It's a common image in geology textbooks: Molten  magma wells up from the planet's bowels to the seafloor at  midocean ridges, giving birth to new slabs of the earth's crust. The  magma, a fiery orange or red, ascends in teardrop-shaped blobs  through what look like inverted funnels or gigantic pipes.

There's a problem with that image, say scientists at the  University of California, Santa Cruz. It's probably wrong.

Instead of a pipe, the plumbing under a midocean ridge acts  like a sponge, and a very bad sponge at that. A typical chunk of the  earth's mantle in one of these zones, the scientists believe, holds  just 1 or 2 parts magma per 1,000 parts unmelted rock--a far  smaller ratio than predicted by the reigning model of seafloor  spreading.

What's more, as the magma oozes upward through tiny  channels, it appears to stay in chemical contact with the mantle  rocks around it. Other researchers have assumed that once magma  forms deep under the ocean floor, it rises quickly and no longer  reacts with the surrounding mantle.

"Midocean ridges are the biggest magmatic systems on the  planet," says Quentin Williams, associate professor of earth  sciences at UCSC. "The previous picture of how these systems work  may not be accurate. The chemistry of what comes out at the top  seems to tell us that the magma percolates upward instead of  flowing through conduits, and that it continuously bathes the mantle  in a very small amount of melt."

A research team at UCSC led by graduate student Craig  Lundstrom published its results in the December 22 issue of the  journal Science. Coauthors are professor of earth sciences James  Gill, a geochemist, and Williams, a mineral physicist.

The team analyzed rocks collected by other scientists with the  submersible vessel ALVIN off the Pacific Northwest coast. The rocks  had erupted recently at the Juan de Fuca Ridge, where new oceanic  crust forms at the rate of a few centimeters per year. Juan de Fuca  is but a minor part of a globe-encircling network of ocean ridges,  such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the East Pacific Rise. The ridges  stretch some 60,000 kilometers and churn out about 80 percent of  all magma on the planet each year.

Oceanic crust emerges in this way: Magma, known as basalt,  begins to melt from the solid mantle about 100 kilometers under the  ocean. When this buoyant material rises to within about 20  kilometers of the midocean ridge, it enters a chamber of magma-- the source material for future eruptions. Once it erupts, the basalt  hardens into slabs of crust. The crust spreads slowly away from the  ridge atop a thicker layer of mantle, depleted of its basalt.

In the most popular model of this process, the magma makes a  clean break once it melts out of the mantle. It ascends rapidly (on a  geologic timescale) via some sort of direct plumbing to the magma  chamber. Along the way, the model dictates, the basalt does not  interact chemically with the rest of the mantle. This picture seemed  consistent with the few observations of midocean ridges, shrouded  as they are by the sea's chilly depths.

Lundstrom and his coworkers applied a potent and relatively  new tool to test the model. The tool uses the radioactive decay of  uranium, a heavy element in basalt, as a geochemical tracer. On its  train ride of decay to the stable element lead, uranium stops at  several other elemental stations, including protactinium, thorium,  and radium. These elements make a series of "parent" and "daughter"  isotopes, each with well-known rates of decay. The ratios of the  isotopes yield intriguing clues about the chemical and physical  travels of the magma.

All three elements indicate that the basalt stays in constant  chemical equilibrium with the solid mantle as it rises. Only at the  last possible moment, when the melt separates from the rest of the  mantle and joins the magma chamber, does it acquire a unique  chemical signature. This implies that the melt seeps through tiny  cracks, much as groundwater leaches through porous rocks. To  satisfy the team's data, the melt must squeeze through spaces that  compose a minuscule fraction of the mantle--just one-tenth to two-tenths of a percent.

"The amount of melt at any spot beneath the ridge is  vanishingly small," says Lundstrom. "Even so, it can move at high  rates." Indeed, the team's model predicts that magma wends its way  through those tight spaces at one to several meters per year.  Meanwhile, the solid mantle around it creeps upward relentlessly  toward the ridge axis at about five centimeters per year. Says  Williams: "It's like a fast conveyor belt on top of a slow one."

To make the model work, the team had to invoke veins of  basalt-rich mantle far beneath the spreading centers, where the  melting begins. Such veins could persist in the mantle, says  Williams, if old slabs of oceanic crust don't mix completely into the  rest of the mantle after they plunge back into the earth at  subduction zones.
