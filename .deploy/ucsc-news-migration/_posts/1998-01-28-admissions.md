SANTA CRUZ, CA--During the November filing period, 15,889 prospective  students applied for admission to UC Santa Cruz for fall 1998, an increase  of 8.8 percent over applications received at the same time last year.

The total was the most ever received by UCSC during the open filing  period, reported J. Michael Thompson, UCSC's associate vice chancellor for  enrollment management and director of admissions. The fall 1998  application totals for the entire University of California system were  released this morning by UC's Office of the President.

"The increase in applications demonstrates that college-going  students and their families have an increasingly better understanding of the  quality and breadth of UC Santa Cruz's academic programs," said Thompson.  "We're gratified that the message that our whole campus community has  been sending out--about the quality of our academics and the success of our  alumni--is getting through."

UCSC experienced the fourth-highest increase in freshman  applications among the nine UC campuses: Freshman applications rose 11.6  percent, from 11,233 last year to 12,535 this year. The fall 1998  admissions process marks the first time that UCSC will admit freshmen and  transfer students under both a revised UC policy and a new state law  prohibiting the use of race, gender, and ethnicity in admissions decisions.  Applications to UCSC from underrepresented minority students rose  3 percent, from 3,007 last year to 3,122 this year.

"We are pleased that more students from underrepresented groups  applied to UC Santa Cruz for next fall," said Francisco Hernandez, vice  chancellor for student affairs. "In a number of ways, students, faculty, and  staff have put forth extraordinary effort to let students know about our  campus."

As part of the campus's program, "Reaching Out for Our Future," UCSC  students returned to their old high schools to talk to the students there  about the university. UCSC also hosted overnight  visits of more than 200 youths from 17 high schools in northern and central  California. It also sent Rainbow Theater, a student performance troupe  dedicated to multicultural plays, to Los Angeles to perform at community  colleges and high schools.

"Reaching Out" is supported by matching funds from UCSC's  Chancellor's Office and Office of Admissions in addition to UC's Office of  the President.
