SANTA CRUZ, CA--Marc S. Mangel, a professor of environmental studies at UC  Santa Cruz, has been named associate vice chancellor for planning and  programs. The appointment, which takes effect July 1, was announced today  (June 24) by Executive Vice Chancellor Michael Tanner.

Mangel will work with Tanner and the staff of the Planning and Budget  Office on issues of academic planning, resource allocation, new programs,  and interdivisional initiatives. He will also oversee external reviews of  degree-offering units on campus.

Mangel came to UCSC in 1996 from UC Davis, where he was director of  the Center for Population Biology from 1989 to 1993. His past  administrative experience also includes a term as chair of the Mathematics  Department at UC Davis from 1984 to 1989.

Mangel's research focuses on the ecological implications of natural  variation within populations of organisms. He has spent many years studying  the life-history variations of Atlantic salmon and is examining similar  questions regarding steelhead trout along California's Central Coast. He has  also studied "fruit flies of economic importance," including the Medfly and  the apple maggot, and is embarking on the study of butterflies, which also  damage plants by laying eggs that hatch and eat their host plant.

Mangel replaces economics professor Carl E. Walsh, who assumed the  position on a half-time basis July 1, 1995.
