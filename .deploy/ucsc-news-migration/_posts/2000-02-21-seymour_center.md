## UC Santa Cruz's New Marine Science Education Center Offers A View Of The Ocean Realm Through The Eyes Of Marine Scientists

## The Seymour Center At Long Marine Laboratory Will Hold A Grand Opening Celebration On The Weekend Of March 11-12, 2000

SANTA CRUZ, CA--A spectacular new science education center overlooking the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary will open to the public in March, offering visitors a unique view into the workings of a world-class marine research laboratory. The Seymour Marine Discovery Center, located at Long Marine Laboratory at the University of California, Santa Cruz, will feature galleries full of aquariums and exhibits, touch tanks, classrooms, an 87-foot blue whale skeleton, a gift and book shop, and much more.

The exhibits and aquariums at the Seymour Center will have a very different look and feel from those at other public aquariums, said the center's director Julie Barrett Heffington. Exhibits will focus on the work of researchers at UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences, which operates Long Marine Laboratory.

With its emphasis on scientists and how they study the ocean, the Seymour Center's innovative exhibit space will look something like a research laboratory. Interactive stations will provide "hands-on" experiences, and trained docents will lead tours and answer questions.

"The idea is to give visitors an understanding of the ocean and the wonderful life it supports, while at the same time opening a window into how scientists ask questions, make observations, and figure things out," Heffington said.

Long Marine Laboratory has had a vibrant public education program since it opened in 1978, attracting more than 30,000 visitors annually in recent years. The new 16,250-square-foot center will enable it to serve a projected 80,000 to 100,000 visitors each year.

The goals of the Seymour Center include improving awareness and appreciation of the marine environment, educating visitors about the important role scientific research plays in the conservation and understanding of the world's oceans, and encouraging young people to pursue scientific careers.

The center will capitalize on the research experience and expertise of the scientists at UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory and the Institute of Marine Sciences (IMS). IMS researchers conduct field studies throughout the world, from Antarctica to tropical coral reefs and along the California coast. The faculty includes world-renowned experts on elephant seals, sea otters, whales, and other marine mammals. IMS researchers are also involved in groundbreaking studies of coastal ecology, pollution in the marine environment, erosion of shorelines, and other important ocean-related issues.

In addition to the exhibit galleries, the Seymour Center has a hall for public lectures and films, a teaching laboratory for UCSC marine biology courses, and classrooms for kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) students. One of the K-12 classrooms is a wet lab with running seawater, where students can examine live sea creatures, and the other is equipped with microscopes and other teaching tools.

Long Marine Lab's education programs include professional development for K-12 teachers. The lab also collaborates with school districts and the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary to develop sanctuary-based marine science curricula.

Private donations funded nearly all of the Seymour Center's $6.25 million cost, including a cornerstone contribution from H. Boyd Seymour Jr. of San Francisco. Seymour's gift of $2 million honors his father, Harry Boyd Seymour (1896-1977), and his grandfather, Arthur McArthur Seymour (1864-1919). Numerous other individuals and foundations also made significant gifts.

GRAND OPENING OF THE SEYMOUR CENTER AT LONG MARINE LABORATORY

The grand opening celebration on the weekend of March 11-12 will include live music, food, and special programs throughout the center. The center will be open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday and noon to 5 p.m. on Sunday. Admission fees will be $5 for adults and $3 for seniors (age 60 and older), students, and children ages 6 to 16; admission will be free for children age 5 and under.

Long Marine Lab is located at the end of Delaware Avenue in Santa Cruz, just past Natural Bridges State Beach. After the Seymour Center opens to the public in March, the visiting hours will be Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday from 12 to 5 p.m. For more information, call (831) 459-3800.
