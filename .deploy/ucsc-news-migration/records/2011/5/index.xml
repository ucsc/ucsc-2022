<br/>
The award will be presented by Chancellor Blumenthal at the Staff Advisory Board's Staff Appreciation Picnic on Tuesday, May 10.<br/>
<br/>
McCawley has worked at UCSC for nearly 30 years, starting as a frontline advisor in the Admissions Office.<br/>
<br/>
He initially was shocked at the news he'd received the award, but then "very deeply honored," he said. "It's very meaningful to me."<br/>
<br/>
"I really believe in what we do," he continued. "I really enjoy working directly with students and faculty. We have an amazing staff. There is really something very positive about the work we do, and it can be life-altering. As long as I keep that passion, I'll be doing the work."<br/>
<br/>
Nominators praised McCawley's passion and commitment to his work and to the campus; his tireless dedication and patience, even in the face of seemingly insurmountable tasks; his initiative and innovative approach to problem-solving; his professionalism, fairness, and expertise; and his collegiality, sincerity, and warmth.<br/>
<br/>
He was instrumental in helping the Admissions Office through the long process of conversion to the new Academic Information System, and over the years he has implemented changes to the office's processes that allow students greater opportunity and access, according to nominator Tina Oberlin, senior admissions evaluator.<br/>
<br/>
He leads two UC systemwide endeavors that involve the other campuses: one that has positively influenced frosh from underrepresented and underserved backgrounds, and one that has helped transfer students from the California community colleges.<br/>
<br/>
McCawley leads by example, modeling integrity, honesty, equity, and fairness in his management style, wrote nominator Elaine Rivas, operations manager in the Chancellor's Office.<br/>
<br/>
"He believes that his staff should always be equipped with accurate and up-to-date information and the resources and training required to perform their jobs and represent the campus in the best way possible," wrote Rivas.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to a keen work ethic, deep knowledge of the campus and the admissions process, and strong leadership, McCawley is a compassionate and caring administrator, wrote nominator Debbie Belville, coordinator/advisor in the Linguistics Department.<br/>
<br/>
"I have seen him time and time again sincerely support staff through very difficult health and family times, putting aside 'the work' when there was something more important at hand," wrote Belville.<br/>
<br/>
Established by the Alumni Association in 1995, the Outstanding Staff Award is presented annually to a staff member to recognize sustained, distinguished service by staff to student life, the growth and improvement of UCSC's programs, and the preservation of UCSCs unique intellectual and physical environment. In collaboration with the Staff Advisory Board, the Alumni Association honors the very best among UCSC's dedicated staff.</p>

<br/>
"Teaching entrepreneurship is like teaching medicine," said Dan Heller, the center's executive director. "You can't just teach it in a classroom. You have to apply theories in a real-world environment so students can observe and understand the realities of today&#8217;s marketplace." <br/>
<br/>
The center is working with various campus departments and programs--including computer science, economics, psychology, and digital arts and new media--to create courses that focus on entrepreneurship. These courses will give students the opportunity to work with experienced industry veterans to create pragmatic business models for simulated startup companies. In some cases, the business models may be based on intellectual property created by UCSC researchers or students. <br/>
<br/>
The C4E is also working with faculty to identify promising ideas emerging from campus research labs and educate faculty about the steps involved in turning their innovations into marketable products. <br/>
<br/>
"The UCSC faculty includes leading researchers in a broad range of technological fields, including information technology, energy and sustainability, and biomedicine," said Chancellor George Blumenthal. "The Center for Entrepreneurship will help to increase the influence of these researchers in the worlds of business and industry."<br/>
<br/>
Campus research labs are a rich source of innovative ideas and leading-edge technology. In a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/09/ranking.html">recent analysis</a> of top North American universities, UCSC ranked fourth (behind only Caltech, MIT, and Princeton) in citation impact, a measure of research influence based on the number of times published work is cited by academics. UCSC also ranks ninth in federal research dollars per faculty member when compared to members of the Association of American Universities without medical schools.<br/>
<br/>
One of the C4E's early efforts has been to expand the UCSC business plan competition, which was started in 2009 by students with support from community members, local government, industry representatives, and the university. This year, more than 100 students are participating in the C4E's Business Design Competition. On May 20, eight teams will compete for the opportunity to receive a top award of $10,000. Among them are two plans for nonprofit corporations with an emphasis on green and social technologies, and two that are focused on clean energy.<br/>
<br/>
The local community is enthusiastic about the new entrepreneurship program at UC Santa Cruz, seeing it as a catalyst that will help stimulate economic development in the region. "UCSC is the region's largest economic engine, and capturing the talent, enthusiasm and creativity of its students and faculty is key to regional prosperity," said Peter Koht, economic development coordinator for Santa Cruz. The city has supported the student business plan competition since its inception and partners with the campus on the Project for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, an internship program that places engineers and business majors into local startups. <br/>
<br/>
The city also recently financed a study exploring the benefits of fostering more entrepreneurship among UCSC students and graduates. The study was conducted by an independent nonprofit technology incubator, which is raising venture capital to fund startup companies in Santa Cruz. The incubator, now known as the "Startup Lab," was established by Heller in 2010 as a nonprofit corporation (then called C3E) that is separate from the campus and the UCSC Center for Entrepreneurship. Heller said his plan for the Startup Lab is to create new companies that could license from the university promising technology developed in campus labs and identified by C4E as having commercial potential.<br/>
<br/>
The C4E is operating out of UCSC's Jack Baskin School of Engineering, but is designed to serve students from all disciplines. According to engineering dean Art Ramirez, the C4E's academic activities are designed to give students practical experience in tackling the challenges of entrepreneurship. <br/>
<br/>
"The C4E curriculum mirrors the realities of how multi-faceted challenges are solved," Ramirez said. "Students both learn and experience fundamental principles that are applicable to any career, whether you're starting a business, shaping policy in government, or working for a non-profit corporation."<br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b1fa5c5380727046006b5488939b9cb6"><name>day-by-the-bay</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>'Day by the Bay' attracts large crowd to campus</title><summary>Windy conditions on UCSC's East Field on Saturday required a venue change for UCSC's annual "Day by the Bay" picnic.

<p>Windy conditions on UCSC's East Field on Saturday required a venue change for UCSC's annual "Day by the Bay" picnic. But the 1,500 people who flocked to the Cowell College Courtyard for the annual event found plenty of activities to enjoy: food, beverages, college and department exhibits, and plenty of spectacular student entertainment.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, UCSC alumni Michael Wilson, a pioneer in the emerging field of "green" chemistry, and Drummond Pike, founder of Tides Foundation, headlined the Intellectual Forum at the Humanities Lecture Hall. Kimberly Lau, provost of UCSC's Oakes College, moderated the 90-minute discussion, which focused on social change.</p>

The endowment, "Strengthening Ties Between the Arboretum and Plant Sciences Faculty," is designed to foster more effective collaborative relationships between the Arboretum and UCSC faculty and students in the plant sciences.</p>
<p>The endowment has two main areas of focus: supporting Arboretum staff to assist with teaching and research related to plant science, and funding exhibits and displays at the Arboretum to highlight the plant sciences research of UCSC faculty and students.</p>
<p>"Jean Langenheim's endowment goes to the core of the Arboretum," said Arboretum director Brett Hall. "This generous endowment will foster tremendous learning and mutual support for research and conservation, while developing rich collaboration with the plant science faculty and graduate researchers. Jean Langenheim has long been a highly esteemed scholar, a leader in plant sciences, and an inspiring figure on campus. With this endowment, she is providing the magic to make good things happen."</p>
<p>An eminent plant ecologist, Langenheim has been involved with the Arboretum since she joined the UCSC faculty in 1966. She worked closely with Kenneth Thimann, a renowned plant physiologist and founding provost of Crown College, who helped shape the Arboretum into an internationally known horticultural site.</p>
<p>"Kenneth Thimann was very committed to the Arboretum and encouraged all the plant science faculty to use it as a resource for educational and research activities," Langenheim said. "This endowment is meant to reinforce and strengthen those academic ties."</p>
<p>Although plant science is the primary focus of the endowment, it can also be used to provide support for faculty and students working with animals that interact with plants, such as birds and insects. The endowment will be administered by a committee that includes Arboretum staff and plant science faculty from Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Environmental Studies, and other departments with faculty engaged in plant science research.</p>
<p>Ingrid Parker, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, will serve on the committee as holder of the Langenheim Chair in Plant Ecology and Evolution. "I'm excited about how this endowment provides a catalyst for creativity in our work. In discussions between faculty and Arboretum staff, we have already generated a dozen novel ideas for ways to build capacity and share the lessons of ongoing research with the community," Parker said. "Our Arboretum is not only a place with an exceptional collection of plants from around the world, it is also a vibrant community of people who are interested in plant biodiversity and horticulture. We all have a lot to gain from our interactions."</p>
<p>Michael Loik, associate professor of environmental studies, said the Arboretum serves teaching and research needs not only on the UCSC campus, but for institutions throughout the world. "The Arboretum is a storehouse of tremendous biodiversity, and the staff is very knowledgeable, so people contact them for botanical samples for a wide variety of studies," he said.</p>
<p>Previous gifts from Langenheim have established the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2007/10/1678.html">endowed chair</a> now held by Parker and a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2004/09/547.html">graduate fellowship</a> in plant ecology and evolution.</p>
<p>"Jean has been an amazing presence on our campus in terms of her contributions to the field of plant sciences, and her new endowment is one of many ways that she has given back to UCSC," Loik said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b76239f880727046006b548879612d8c"><name>ucsc-in-the-news-5-9-11</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>An episode about elephant seals on KQED's QUEST TV program featured biologists Daniel Costa and Burney Le Boeuf. </summary><start-date>1305014400000</start-date><display-name>ucsc-in-the-news-5-9-11</display-name><path>/2011/05/ucsc-in-the-news-5-9-11</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/05/ucsc-in-the-news-5-9-11</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1304451758443</created-on><last-modified-by>dwhite1</last-modified-by><last-modified>1305049387893</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>An episode about elephant seals on <strong>KQED's QUEST</strong> TV program featured biologists Daniel Costa, Burney Le Boeuf, and others and was reviewed in the <strong><em>San Francisco Chronicle</em></strong> and <strong>Knight Science Journalism Tracker.</strong></p>

The program will be broadcast on Wednesday, May 4, at 7:30 p.m. on KQED 9 and KQED HD (Comcast 709). The program can also be seen online at <a href="http://www.kqed.org/quest/television/into-the-deep-with-elephant-seals">www.kqed.org/quest</a>.</p>
<p>Thousands of northern elephant seals--some weighing up to 4,500 pounds--make an annual migration each winter to breed at A&#241;o Nuevo State Reserve, about 21 miles north of Santa Cruz. UCSC researchers led by Costa, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, are using high-tech tools to track the migrations of the elephant seals and understand what they do underwater, where they spend most of their lives.</p>
<p>"They just really are amazing animals," Costa says in the program. "Everything they do is to the extreme--they're extreme divers, they're extreme fasting animals, they're extreme in their ability to conserve water."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b87863d380727046006b54889cc77fcd"><name>jewish-studies-conference</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Jewish Studies conference set for UC Santa Cruz on May 22-24</title><summary>A conference designed to highlight the role women have played in the forging of Italian Jewish identity will take place May 22-24, on the UC Santa Cruz campus.</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, ucsc, jewish studies program, Venice, Italy, Venice, women</keywords><start-date>1304470800000</start-date><display-name>Jewish Studies conference</display-name><path>/2011/05/jewish-studies-conference</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/05/jewish-studies-conference</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1304469988191</created-on><last-modified-by>jrburns</last-modified-by><last-modified>1308694356684</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Feminist Studies</value><value>History</value><value>Jewish Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Community</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>International</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/05/images/JSposter-3001.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/05/images/JSposter-3001.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>JSposter-3001.jpg</name><display-name>JSposter-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>66192</file-size><width>300</width><height>464</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/05/images/JS-confr-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/05/images/JS-confr-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>JS-confr-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>JS-confr-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>17976</file-size><width>81</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Preview panel discussion to take place at Museo Italo-Americano in San Francisco </article-subhead><article-text><p>A conference designed to highlight the role women have played in the forging of Italian Jewish identity will take place May 22-24, on the UC Santa Cruz campus.<br/>
<br/>
Titled &#8220;Women, Jews, Venetians,&#8221; the event is sponsored by the Center for Jewish Studies of the University of California, Santa Cruz, the UCSC Literature Department, the Museo Italo-Americano of San Francisco, and the Venice Center for International Jewish Studies.<br/>
<br/>
Murray Baumgarten--co-director of UCSC&#8217;s Jewish Studies program--noted that many people are unaware of the intensive interaction that took place between the Jews of the Venice Ghetto with the larger Venetian population.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;An island set apart from and yet part of the city on the lagoon, the Ghetto became a political, social, and cultural locus of historical and symbolic status,&#8221; said Baumgarten. &#8220;Yet the roles women played in this forging of modern Jewish identity are often absent from the conversation.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
He added that the contribution of women has not been fully charted as to how--and to what extent&#8212;they were able to participate and take the lead in many spheres, from cultural practices and financial activities, to intellectual pursuits.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our gathering is directed to bringing women into the Venetian historical account,&#8221; said Baumgarten.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will focus on the ways in which Jewish women--in part through their connections to other Venetian and Italian women--helped to articulate what it was to be modern, and thus contributed in shaping the image and understanding of contemporary Venice and Venetian Jewish life.&#8221;</p>
<p>He noted that the conference will approach the topic through multiple disciplines, including literature, history, and art history.</p>
<p>Over the past several years, Baumgarten has directed three summer institutes about Italian Jewish life at the site of the first ghetto in Italy-in collaboration with the University of Venice and funded with grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities.</p>
<p>He also provided the academic expertise for a 2009 exhibition at the Museo Italo-Americano in San Francisco, <strong>Il Ghetto: Forging Italian Jewish Identities 1516-1870</strong>, that examined more than 350 years of Jewish life in Italy--the gateway through which Jewish culture in Europe was established.</p>
<p>&#8220;What I've tried to do with both the Venice Institute and the San Francisco exhibit is to create portals into history and culture,&#8221; said Baumgarten.</p>
<p>In addition to the conference at UCSC, there will also be a preview panel at the Museo Italo-Americano in Fort Mason, San Francisco, on Sunday morning, May 22,&#160;from 9:30 am to 12:30 p.m.--in conjunction with exhibited materials from <em>Il Ghetto: Forging Italian Jewish Identities</em>.</p>

<p>A UCSC alumnus, Novack&#160;has served as president of the foundation since 2009 and has been a board trustee for 14 years. He was a UC Regent from 2003 to 2005.</p>
<p>Novack holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from UCSC with a major in biology and minors in physics and religious studies (Kresge '73). He received his Ph.D. from UC Davis in pharmacology/toxicology and his post-doctoral training in neurophysiology from UCLA.</p>
<p>Novack is currently the founder and president of PharmaLogic, a firm that provides research and development consulting services to pharmaceuticals and medical device firms.

The event takes place from 1:30 to 4:30 p.m.</p>
<p>In its seventh year, the symposium is designed to recognize and promote the outstanding and diverse research being carried out by graduate students from all disciplines on campus. It is also an opportunity for graduate students to gather as part of the larger UCSC graduate community and to become better acquainted with the scope of research campuswide.</p>
<p>"Our graduate students are already beginning their careers as cutting-edge researchers," said Tyrus Miller, vice provost and dean of graduate studies. "The symposium will give attendees a sneak preview of the groundbreaking UCSC graduate work that will soon be making an impact in the realms of creative, technical, and commercial innovation."</p>
<p>A panel of judges will determine recipients of a number of best-of-symposium awards; UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal and Miller will present cash prizes at the conclusion of this year's event.</p>

<br/>
Yolanda Diaz-Houston was one of five recipients selected by the regional Rotary district that includes Santa Cruz county. The $12,500 grant will help her pay tuition and traveling expenses next year in support of two three-month research trips to the far north of India.</p>
<p>This fall and next spring, she plans to study the impact of education on the lives of orphan girls at a rural community center. More specifically, Diaz-Houston is looking at the impact that volunteers from other countries have on the educational experiences of the young orphans.<br/>
<br/>
Diaz-Houston was once a volunteer herself at the rural orphanage where 75 percent of the orphans are girls, ages infant to late teens. "Girls are the most likely to be abandoned," Diaz-Houston said.<br/>
<br/>
The surrounding villages lack reliable electricity and water supplies. The average wage is less than $2 a day.&#160; The community center sits on the edge of a jungle and is reached by taxi after traveling four hours by train north from Delhi.<br/>
<br/>
Volunteers come from many countries, she said, but are primarily from the United States and Canada. The community center includes the only medical clinic and school in the area which nearly 500 children from surrounding villages attend, in addition to the orphans. Diaz-Houston said she'll mostly be working with girls high school age and older.<br/>

system</article-subhead><article-text><p>Planetary scientist Carolyn Porco will present findings from the Cassini spacecraft now in orbit around Saturn in a free public lecture on Wednesday, May 25, at 7 p.m. Porco's talk, "In the Land of Enchantment: Cassini Explores the Saturn System," will take place at the Rio Theater, 1205 Soquel Avenue, in Santa Cruz. The event is free and open to the public, but <a href="http://community.ucsc.edu/hallidaylecture2011">online registration</a> is advised to reserve seats.</p>
<p>Porco is the leader of the Cassini imaging science team and director of the Cassini Imaging Central Laboratory for Operations at the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado. She is also an adjunct professor in the Department of Astrophysical and Planetary Sciences at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Her contributions to the exploration of the outer solar system include imaging work on the Voyager missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Launched in 1997, NASA's Cassini spacecraft arrived at Saturn in 2004 and has sent back a steady stream of data from Saturn and its moons. Cassini also carried the Huygens probe, which landed on the surface of Titan, Saturn's largest moon, in 2005. The images collected by the Cassini mission are being closely examined in the pursuit of precise scientific information about the nature of Saturn and its remarkable system of rings and moons.</p>
<p>Porco has appeared frequently on CNN as a guest analyst and consultant on planetary science. Her experience explaining science to the layman includes recent appearances on CBS's "60 Minutes," the Emmy-nominated TV documentary "Cosmic Journey: The Voyager Interstellar Mission and Message" on A&amp;E, and many TV programs on the Cassini mission. She was also a consultant for the movie <em>Contact.</em></p>
<p>Porco's talk is part of the Halliday Lecture Series presented by the UCSC Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics and the UC Observatories/Lick Observatory. This year's lecture has been generously sponsored by Robert Sieker. Originally created by a gift from benefactor John Halliday, the Halliday Lectures are supported by private donors to UCSC astronomy to promote public awareness and appreciation of astronomy.</p>

Asunto: Graffiti ofensivos en el campus</p>
<p>06 de mayo 2011</p>
<p>Esta ma&#241;ana me enter&#233; sobre un graffiti ofensivo que fue descubierto en un ba&#241;o de hombres en el Colegio de Cowell. El graffiti inclu&#237;a una amenaza espec&#237;fica contra los "mexicanos".</p>
<p>Este incidente es muy preocupante, y quiero recordar a todos los miembros de la comunidad universitaria, que no se toleran el discurso de odio de cualquier tipo en este campus.</p>
<p>La polic&#237;a est&#225; investigando este incidente como un crimen de odio potencial. Si usted tiene alguna informaci&#243;n sobre este graffiti, reportelo inmediatamente a la Polic&#237;a de UCSC al (831) 459-2231. Usted puede hacer su reporte de forma an&#243;nima por l&#237;nea de internet <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/police/crime.html">online</a> o llamando al 459-3TIP (459 a 3.847). El graffiti fue removido despu&#233;s de que las autoridades lo documentaron para su investigaci&#243;n.</p>
<p>Quiero hacerles saber a los estudiantes, el personal y la facultad sobre el apoyo disponible para cualquier persona que haya sido afectada por este incidente.</p>
<p>UCSC promueve un clima de inclusi&#243;n que respeta los estudiantes, profesores, personal, e invitados de todas las razas, religiones, grupos &#233;tnicos, tradiciones, or&#237;genes, orientaciones y culturas. Yo creo que una comunidad diversa que fomenta la comprensi&#243;n y la tolerancia, y mejora la experiencia educativa, es lo mas importante de la misi&#243;n de la UC.</p>
<p>Por favor, &#250;nanse a m&#237; y juntos condenemos este incidente y reafirmemos nuestro compromiso con los <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/about/principles-community.html">Principios de la UCSC Comunidad</a>.

<p>Most of these labors take place in libraries, laboratories, and offices, or out in the field. The 7<sup>th</sup> annual Graduate Research Symposium on Friday, May 6, gave these researchers a chance to show off in public for a while, highlighting their achievements before a large group of faculty, staff, friends, and colleagues at the University Center.</p>
<p>A panel of judges awarded prizes for outstanding oral presentations, interactive media, and research poster displays that boiled complex projects down to key paragraphs and striking visuals.</p>
<p>One of the judges was Professor Tyrus Miller, vice provost and dean of Graduate Studies, who presented the awards this year.</p>
<p>Miller said the judges valued clarity, vividness, and relevance. They expected participants to distill complex concepts and present them in a clear and lucid way that non-experts can understand.</p>
<p>&#8220;They need to convey the importance of the project &#8211; the &#8216;so what&#8217; element,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;They need to communicate specialized information to an educated and informed but non-expert audience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among the winners was Jennifer Maresh, a graduate student in ecology and evolutionary biology. Even the title of her project sounds fantastically complicated: "The Economics of Movement in 3 Dimensions: the At-Sea Biomechanics and Energetic Costs of Swimming in a Marine Top Predator."</p>
<p>But Maresh summarized her project in a concise and elegant way: She is studying the effects of disturbances on elephant seals as they try to forage for fish and squid.</p>
<p>"How do these disturbances, including human impact, affect their swimming behavior, their movements, and their ability to make a living from foraging?&#8221; Maresh said. &#8220;How resilient are they in terms of responding to disturbances?"</p>

<p><span>A large and appreciative crowd of staff members ate marinated chicken, vied for raffle prizes, and danced to a cheeky song by Cee Lo Green during the annual UCSC Staff Appreciation Barbecue on the East Field.</span><span></span><span></span></p>
<p><span>An estimated 1,000 people showed up for the big party. Staff members danced to a band made up entirely of UCSC staffers, who belted out such classics as Phil Everly&#8217;s &#8220;When Will I Be Loved.&#8221; Later they played "(Forget) You," the clean version of Cee Lo Green&#8217;s hit song.</span></p>
<p><span>The crowd cheered and clapped for Michael McCawley, associate director of Admissions, who has been selected as the 2010-11 UCSC Alumni Association Outstanding Staff Award recipient. McCawley has worked at UCSC for nearly 30 years, starting as a frontline advisor in the Admissions Office.</span></p>
<p><span>Before presenting him with the award, Chancellor George Blumenthal described McCawley as &#8220;tireless, dedicated, innovative, warm and sincere,&#8221; embodying the spirit and the tradition of UCSC staff members.</span></p>
<p><span>Blumenthal extended his appreciation to the entire crowd.</span></p>
<p><span>"I want to thank you all personally,&#8221; he said. "Even in these difficult times, we&#8217;ve been remarkably successfully at meeting the needs of students &#8230; You <em>are</em> UCSC."</span></p>
<p><span>The barbecue, sponsored by the Staff Advisory Board with support from the Chancellor's Office and administrative divisions, included the campus&#8217;s own UCSC Catering service, focusing on locally grown and organic items.</span></p>
<p><span>Booths displayed staff services, benefits and activities on campus. One display booth promoted the upcoming UC Walks event, a University of California system-wide health and fitness day; participants will spent at least a half an hour of May 18 on a brisk walk.</span></p>
<p><span>The event is designed to encourage UC staff workers to incorporate walking or general fitness into their daily schedules. During the appreciation barbecue, staff members filled out a sign-up sheet, pledging their participation in the UC Walks day. In return they were given free commemorative UC Walks T-shirts showing a giant foot superimposed across the University of California logo.</span></p>

<p>Proton therapy is a type of radiation therapy that allows powerful doses of radiation to be delivered directly to a tumor with little damage to the surrounding healthy tissues. Currently, images and data for planning and guidance of proton therapy are obtained from x-ray computed tomography (commonly known as a CT scan or CAT scan). But using information from x-rays to guide proton beams results in uncertainties that limit the accuracy with which the tumor can be targeted.</p>
<p>To overcome these limitations, researchers at the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP) at UC Santa Cruz and their collaborators have been working since 2003 to develop the technology needed to perform proton computed tomography. This technology uses proton beams in the same way that x-rays are used in a regular CT scan.</p>
<p>"We have spent our whole careers building detectors to record charged particles, so we knew we could built a detector for proton tomography, and now we have a working prototype," said Hartmut Sadrozinski, a research physicist who leads work on the project at SCIPP.</p>
<p>A new four-year, $2 million grant from the National Institutes of Health is funding current efforts to translate proton CT from the physics laboratory to clinical application, with about half of the funding going to UC Santa Cruz. Dr. Reinhard Schulte, an associate professor of radiation medicine, leads the project at Loma Linda, where the world's first hospital-based proton therapy center was built in 1990.</p>
<p>X-rays and proton beams have similar biological effects on cells, causing radiation damage to molecules within the cells. The increased susceptibility of cancer cells to radiation damage allows selective destruction of tumor cells with x-rays. But x-rays affect all of the tissues along the path of the x-ray beam through the body, whereas a proton beam can be tuned to deposit its energy mostly in a targeted area where the tumor is, with virtually no energy deposited beyond the target. This allows the use of higher radiation doses in proton therapy than can be safely used in x-ray therapy. It is also possible, if a tumor is adjacent to a critical structure in the body, to direct the proton beam so that it stops in the tumor without entering or causing any damage to the adjacent tissue behind the tumor.</p>
<p>The trick is to give the protons just the right amount of energy so that they will stop within the targeted area. An x-ray CT scan provides high-resolution images of the tumor and surrounding tissues, but it does not provide all the information needed to predict the exact range of protons passing through the tissues. With proton CT, it should be possible to design proton therapy to deliver radiation doses that conform precisely to the shape of the tumor on a daily basis.</p>
<p>"For proton CT, we tune the proton beam so that it passes through the patient, and we measure the residual energy in the protons, which tells us how much energy was lost," Sadrozinski said. Computed tomography techniques can then generate a three-dimensional picture of how the tissues in the body interact with the proton beam. "Then you can set the energy of the proton beam so that the protons stop right in the tumor."</p>
<p>The current proton CT prototype , which was built at SCIPP with support from Loma Linda University Medical Center and Northern Illinois University, is being tested on models of the human body (known to radiologists as "phantoms") and has not been used on actual patients. Researchers are focusing now on increasing the speed of the imaging process in order to limit radiation exposure and reduce the amount of time a patient would have to spend in the scanner. "We want to match the speed of a normal CT scan," Sadrozinski said.</p>
<p>Sadrozinski and Robert Johnson, professor of physics at UC Santa Cruz, used the same "silicon strip" detector technology for this project that they and other SCIPP researchers used to build detectors for major particle physics instruments, including the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2008/08/2386.html">Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope</a> and the ATLAS detector at the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2008/08/2374.html">Large Hadron Collider</a> (LHC) at CERN.

Scientists involved in the study recommended the extension of a marine park on the coast of Central Africa and better international cooperation to manage this threatened species.</p>
<p>The study was published May 11 in the online journal <em>PLoS ONE.</em> First author Sara Maxwell, who led the study as a graduate student at University of California, Santa Cruz, said it provides novel insights into the movements of olive ridleys and how to better protect them.</p>
<p>"Thousands of olive ridley sea turtles are caught every year in fishing nets along the coast of Central Africa, yet we previously had no understanding of their movements or what areas are critical to protect their populations," said Maxwell, now a postdoctoral fellow with the Marine Conservation Institute.</p>
<p>In the first comprehensive tracking study of olive ridley sea turtles during the nesting season, the authors used satellite transmitters to follow 18 female turtles during their journeys ashore to lay eggs. The nesting season brings the turtles closest to the coastline and to the danger of being captured in fishing nets.&#160;</p>
<p>Turtles were tagged in Mayumba National Park, a 900-square-kilometer marine protected area on the southern coast of Gabon. Mayumba National Park and Conkouati-Douli National Park just across the border in the Republic of Congo were created to protect both olive ridley and leatherback sea turtles from fishing nets, but dozens of dead olive ridley sea turtles have continued to wash up on the shores of the park every year.&#160; These deaths have perplexed park managers and resulted in mounting concern about the health of this threatened species.&#160;</p>
<p>"What we found, however, made sense," said coauthor Angela Formia of the Wildlife Conservation Society. "Turtles were regularly moving outside of the park boundaries where we believe they were encountering fishing nets and drowning, and later washing ashore where we would see them."</p>
<p>The study revealed another critical finding: the tagged turtles spent more than half of their time in the Republic of Congo waters, highlighting the need for international cooperation to protect this species. The Wildlife Conservation Society is now working in conjunction with the national park agencies of both countries to join and expand Mayumba and Conkouati-Douli National Parks, creating what is the first international marine park in this region of the world.&#160;</p>
<p>"The proposal to combine and extend the protected areas will be incredibly effective," said coauthor Brendan Godley, professor at University of Exeter Cornwall and coordinator of the Marine Turtle Research Group.&#160; "We estimate that 97 percent of the most critical habitat for this population of olive ridley sea turtles would fall within the expanded park boundaries."</p>
<p>"Our results clearly provide a solid foundation for the implementation and extension of the transboundary marine protected area," said coauthor Michael Coyne, director of the non-profit SeaTurtle.org, which hosts a website where the sea turtles can be followed online by the public.</p>
<p>Studies such as this highlight the critical importance of international cooperation in managing and protecting long-lived and migratory species such as sea turtles, Maxwell said. This work also demonstrates the power of satellite tracking technology to show where animals are going and how to better protect them.</p>
<p>"This is a great example of how innovative science on the ecological needs of wide-ranging, long-lived marine species can help justify regional collaborations for effective conservation," said coauthor Dan Costa, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>

The finding, from a study published this week in the journal <em>Science</em>, is the first direct confirmation of such a magma layer at Io and explains how Io can be the most volcanic object known in the solar system. The research was conducted by scientists at UCLA, UC Santa Cruz and the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.</p>
<p>Coauthor Francis Nimmo, associate professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz, said that all rocky planets probably started out like Io--volcanically active and mostly molten on the inside. "People have generally assumed that Io's interior is partly molten because of its prodigious volcanic activity, but this study is the first to actually measure how much melt is present and where it's located," he said.</p>
<p>"Scientists are excited that we finally understand where Io's magma is coming from and have an explanation for some of the mysterious signatures we saw in some of the Galileo's magnetic field data," said Krishan Khurana, lead author of the study, former co-investigator on Galileo's magnetometer team, and a research geophysicist at UCLA. "It turns out Io was continually giving off a 'sounding signal' in Jupiter's rotating magnetic field that matched what would be expected from molten or partially molten rocks deep beneath the surface."</p>
<p>Io's volcanoes are the only known active magma volcanoes in the solar system other than those on Earth. Io produces about 100 times more lava each year than all the volcanoes on Earth. While Earth's volcanoes occur in localized hotspots like the "Ring of Fire" around the Pacific Ocean, Io's volcanoes are distributed all over its surface. A global magma ocean under about 20 to 30 miles (30 to 50 kilometers) of Io's crust helps explain the moon's activity.</p>
<p>"It has been suggested that both the Earth and moon may have had similar magma oceans billions of years ago at the time of their formation, but they have long since cooled," said Torrence Johnson, who was the Galileo project scientist, based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, and was not directly involved in the study. "Io's volcanism informs us how volcanoes work and provides a window in time to styles of volcanic activity that may have occurred on the Earth and moon during their earliest history."</p>
<p>Io's volcanoes were discovered by NASA's Voyager spacecraft in 1979. The energy for the volcanic activity comes from the squeezing and stretching of the moon by Jupiter's gravity as Io orbits the largest planet in the solar system.</p>
<p>Galileo was launched in 1989 and began orbiting Jupiter in 1995. After a successful mission, the spacecraft was intentionally sent into Jupiter&#8217;s atmosphere in 2003. The unexplained signatures in the magnetic field data occurred during Galileo flybys of Io in October 1999 and February 2000, during the final phase of the mission. "But at the time, models of the interaction between Io and Jupiter's immense magnetic field, which bathes the moon in charged particles, were not yet sophisticated enough for us to understand what was going on in Io's interior" said Xianzhe Jia, a coauthor of the study at the University of Michigan.</p>
<p>The magma ocean layer on Io appears to be more than 30 miles (50 kilometers) thick, making up at least 10 percent of the moon's mantle by volume. The blistering temperature of the magma ocean probably exceeds 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit (1,200 degrees Celsius).</p>

<br/>
In honor of this newly established award by arts dean David Yager, Limbrick will present a free public lecture to discuss his research on Monday, May 23, at 6 p.m. in the UCSC Communications Building, Studio C.<br/>
<br/>
Limbrick&#8217;s book explores how colonialism helped shape the cinemas of three &#8220;settler&#8221; societies&#8212;the United States, Australia, and New Zealand.<br/>
<br/>
Settler societies are those in which the colonizers never left, but instead displaced indigenous peoples, made the land their home, and developed their own national identities. <br/>
<br/>
Limbrick argues that because of similar colonial relationships, the cinemas of all three countries are connected and have a great deal in common.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;In the period I looked at&#8212;the 1920s to 1950s&#8212;Australia and New Zealand were still trying to reckon with their own national identity, while American cinema was in the classical period&#8212;its heyday,&#8221; said Limbrick. <br/>
<br/>
&#8220;But even in some of John Ford&#8217;s most famous Westerns, you can still see the throes of original imperial power and an uneasy sense of national identity.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Limbrick noted that none of those films now look at all progressive in their depiction of indigenous peoples.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Doing this historical work helps us get a fuller perspective on the colonial world,&#8221; he noted.<br/>
<br/>
Limbrick looked at production relationships beyond the actual contents of the films&#8212;such as how the films were talked about in the press and what the actors said about them&#8212;and in one case collaborated with a film archive to re-exhibit an overlooked film from the 1950s. <br/>
<br/>
He also studied home movies, scrapbooks, and business records to get a better sense of the context for the films and to discover what was involved in conceiving, planning, and making them.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Instead of just writing them off as old films, we need to look at them more closely to understand them better,&#8221; said Limbrick.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Sometimes films will reveal things about difficult historical encounters in ways that are quite unexpected.&#8221;<br/>

<p>Participants in Bike to Work Day, part of the 24<sup>th</sup> annual Santa Cruz County Bike Week, formed a large and enthusiastic group on Thursday, ranging from teenagers to AARP members. They took part in a festive community day that promotes healthy living, diminishes stress, and cuts down on auto emissions.</p>
<p>"Our motto for this season is &#8216;A Well-Rounded Commute,&#8217;" said UCSC alumna Hannah Hodgson, who works for Ecology Action, the private nonprofit environmental group that is hosting the Santa Cruz County Bike Week in conjunction with UCSC&#8217;s Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS.)</p>
<p>"When you bike, you&#8217;re out in the community," said Hodgson, who was volunteering at the Bike to Work table in front of New Leaf Community Market&#8217;s Westside store on Fair Avenue in Santa Cruz. "You are more aware of your neighbors. You&#8217;re another familiar face. You&#8217;re removing cars from the road, and reducing emissions."</p>
<p>The market was mobbed. At 8:45 a.m. Thursday, more than 50 bicyclists were snacking, drinking coffee, and listening to live acoustic music. Some had free bike tune-ups courtesy of&#160; employees from the nearby Another Bike Shop on Mission Street.</p>
<p>Bike To Work Day is the cornerstone of the Bike Week program, which emphasizes safety, community and fun.</p>
<p>With this goal in mind, organizers set up breakfast stations from 6:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. throughout the Santa Cruz area, including several stations located on or close to the UCSC campus.</p>
<p>One station, at UCSC&#8217;s Seymour Discovery Center at Long Marine Lab, offered hot whole-grain apple-cinnamon swirl bread, preservative-free bagels, organic cream cheese, sage honey, Odwalla orange juice, and coffee to participants.</p>
<p>The Seymour Center station drew biking enthusiasts including Shivano Ross. She works in information technology services, serving as tech lead for University Relations at UC Santa Cruz, but when it comes to commuting, she prefers a low-tech method: the vintage 1970s Gitane bike she plucked from a Dumpster.</p>
<p>"There was a big neighborhood clean-up," Ross said. "People were taking stuff out of their basements."</p>
<p>After rescuing the bike, she patched it up a bit, wrapping the handlebars and changing the brakes.</p>
<p>Since then, she&#8217;s had many bike-commuting adventures with that hardy Gitane. Once, during a busy summer day, she rode her bike from her offices on Delaware Avenue to Pleasure Point. Her friend drove a Prius on the same route.</p>
<p>"I got there first," Ross said. "There was all kinds of traffic that day, but I just zipped right through. I passed so many cars."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.bike2work.com/s_cruz.</url><title>Bike Week events</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="e6a4ed6380727046006b5488a9f2cfc9"><name>commencement</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson joins eclectic UCSC commencement speakers</title><summary>Lisa P.

She was married to the late Donald Osterbrock, who served as director of UC's Lick Observatory from 1973 to 1981 and was a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. Ms. Osterbrock is a long-standing member of the UCSC Women's Club.<br/>
<br/>
Irene Hansen, a native of Williams Bay, Wisconsin, was working as an assistant to William W. Morgan at the Yerkes Observatory when she met graduate student Donald E. Osterbrock. They married shortly after he finished his Ph.D. in 1952. For the next 54 years, Irene helped Don with his work. As he moved gradually into the history of astronomy in his later years, she took a great interest, editing and indexing all of his books and articles and contributing from her personal experience to his book Yerkes Observatory, 1892-1950. <br/>
<br/>
At Lick Observatory, Irene Osterbrock volunteered to help Mary Lea Shane to organize and run the observatory's Mary Lea Shane Archives, and she continued to help manage them after Mrs. Shane's death. She attended nearly all of the Historical Astronomy Division sessions at AAS meetings for many years, accompanying Don, who was the most prolific contributor to those sessions. <br/>
<br/>
The AAS Council may designate any person who has rendered conspicuous service to astronomy other than through scientific contributions as a Patron of the Society. Very few individuals have been so honored during the society's history. A certificate was presented to Ms. Osterbrock at the Seattle AAS meeting in January.<br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="eacdc37f80727046006b5488a7e750ef"><name>seed-library</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>History major wins grant for Central Coast seed library to serve local farmers, gardeners</title><summary>“Initially people are surprised to hear that UC Santa Cruz student Andrew Whitman is a history major.

<br/>
At first glance, it seems odd that a proposal for a seed library to catalog the Central Coast's plant diversity came from a student who spends most of his time in the library instead of one of the many UCSC students getting their hands dirty focusing on field research in environmental studies or sustainable agriculture.<br/>
<br/>
Yet, it is a sound knowledge of the past that led Whitman, 20, to apply for and win a $10,000 grant from the Strauss Foundation for his seed library project..."<br/>

In his book <em>Porn &amp; Pong,</em> Damon Brown argues that games can be used to show how technology has changed our modern sexuality. Brown brings his insider stories and hidden histories to UC Santa Cruz at 11 a.m. on Friday, May 20, with a free public lecture. Brown's talk on "Human Sexuality and Video Games" will take place in Room 180 (Simularium) of the Engineering 2 building on the UCSC campus.</p>
<p>Brown has covered sex, technology, and popular culture for <em>Playboy, New York Post, Planet Out,</em> the AARP, CNN, and more. He holds a master's degree in magazine publishing from Northwestern University and a bachelor's degree in journalism and computing from Detroit's Oakland University.&#160;</p>
<p>Brown's book, <em>Porn &amp; Pong,</em> explores how both pornography and video games have profited from new technologies and influenced our culture in tandem. His talk will reveal the rich subtext that hides just underneath popular games and give the audience a glimpse at where tech, sex, and interactivity will be going in the future.</p>
<p>Brown's talk is co-sponsored by the UC Santa Cruz Center for Games and Playable Media and the Feminism and Pornography Research Cluster.

Steve, who has served our campus as dean of the&#160;<a href="http://pbsci.ucsc.edu/">Division of Physical &amp; Biological Sciences</a>&#160;for the past 5 years, will assume this new post on July 1.</div>
<br/>
<div>Steve, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics who joined our faculty in 1999, has been a superb dean for UCSC. He has maintained strength and hope during budgetary difficulties while simultaneously continuing to build the excellence of the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences. During his tenure, for example, the division has hired an outstanding new generation of faculty &#8212; and they have been doing spectacularly well, receiving such awards and honors as Packard fellowships, Sloan fellowships, and Pew scholarships.</div>
<br/>
<div>Research award support for PBSci faculty has also increased significantly during the past five years, going from $51 million to $68 million annually. Important research and teaching facilities on Science Hill have also been brought on line during Steve's years as dean, including the Physical Sciences Building and the Biomedical Research Facility (nearing completion).</div>
<br/>
<div>Steve also helped develop our campus's Cal Teach program, preparing classes of future science and math teachers.</div>
<br/>
<div>I am in the process of consulting with members of the PBSci community, Academic Senate leadership, and others about the appointment of an acting dean to succeed Steve Thorsett. We will make a formal announcement as soon as that process is completed.</div>
<br/>
<div>In the meantime, please join Chancellor Blumenthal and me in wishing Steve the very best in his new position &#8212; and in thanking him for his important service to our campus.</div></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f9c694c580727046006b548891ccc35f"><name>doyle-book</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Bill Doyle traces the early history of UC Santa Cruz in new book</title><summary>William T.

William T. Doyle, a founding faculty member of UC Santa Cruz, traces the campus's early history in "UC Santa Cruz: 1960-1991."<br/>
 (Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta.)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>William T. Doyle, a founding faculty member of UC Santa Cruz when the campus opened in 1965, has written a book that traces the early history of the campus. <em>UC Santa Cruz: 1960-1991</em> begins with the story of how the campus came to be located in Santa Cruz and describes the challenges of designing and building the new campus.</p>
<p>Doyle, a professor emeritus of biology, held many important administrative positions during his years at UCSC. He is best known for his leadership in the planning and development of the marine science program at UCSC, and several chapters of the book are devoted to those efforts.</p>
<p>In a foreword to the book, Chancellor George Blumenthal wrote that Doyle "was indeed a pioneer, who arrived at a nascent campus with almost no buildings, no academic programs, and very few faculty. His own commitment to the campus led to a string of developments and contributions that spanned his entire career."</p>
<p>By the time he retired in 1991, Doyle had served as chair of biology (twice), dean of the Division of Natural Sciences, a founding faculty member and deputy and acting provost of Oakes College, and director of the Institute of Marine Sciences.</p>
<p>Meticulously researched, and illustrated with more than 80 photographs, Doyle's book describes some of the key people and events that shaped the overall development of the campus. Doyle said he was urged to write the book by faculty, staff, students, and community members who knew of his role in establishing many of the campus's premier science programs and facilities.</p>
<p>No comparable history of UC Santa Cruz has been written, and Doyle said he wanted to correct some of the inaccuracies that have appeared in other publications about the campus. "Some of the oral histories contain incorrect information, which is to be expected from people's recollections of events that happened many years ago. But I didn't want that to be the only published record of the campus's early history," Doyle said.</p>
<p>In the book's introduction, he cites the Cowell College motto, <em>"Pursuit of Truth in the Company of Friends,"</em> which for him served as a motto for the entire campus. Doyle's continued devotion to the campus he helped launch shines through in every chapter of this informative book.</p>
<p>The book is available at <a href="http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/uc-santa-cruz-1960-1991/15109102">www.lulu.com</a>. Royalties will be donated to the Friends of Long Marine Lab to support research and education on coastal and marine issues.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_18627352</url><title>Santa Cruz Sentinel article on Bill Doyle's book</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/05/images/doyle-bill-216.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/05/images/doyle-bill-216.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>doyle-bill-216.jpg</name><display-name>doyle-bill-216.jpg</display-name><file-size>24075</file-size><width>216</width><height>90</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Bill Doyle</thumb-alt><title>BILL DOYLE</title><description>William T.

(Photo: Copyright Ant Farm)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Groundbreaking media art collective best known for Cadillac Ranch</article-subhead><article-text><p><strong>Years before he joined the faculty at UCSC</strong>, Chip Lord was a member of the Ant Farm, a groundbreaking, experimental art and architecture collective he founded in 1968 with fellow architect Doug Michels.</p>
<p>Dedicated to finding alternatives to mainstream architectural practice, the Ant Farm combined video, performance, and sculpture&#8212;achieving widespread notoriety in the mid &#8217;70s for such projects as the Cadillac Ranch public art installation in Texas, and the spectacular performance art event Media Burn.</p>
<p>&#160;&#8220;It was a very different time,&#8221; said Lord. &#8220;I graduated from Tulane School of Architecture in 1968 and there was revolution in the air."</p>
<p>"There was the Vietnam War, student protests, student unrest&#8230;we didn&#8217;t want to go into the corporate architectural world at all, and that was our motivation for starting the Ant Farm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Inspired by such creative thinkers as Buckminster Fuller and Paulo Soleri, the Ant Farm collective spent its early years creating an alternative architecture designed for a nomadic lifestyle.</p>
<p>They built giant inflatable structures&#8212;cheap and easy to assemble&#8212;in opposition to the mainstream Brutalist architecture of the &#8217;60s that emphasized permanent reinforced concrete.</p>
<p>This led to The Truckstop Network, a freewheeling 1970 tour of colleges and universities in the Ant Farm&#8217;s &#8220;Media Van,&#8221; which was equipped with a video portapack, as well as an Eisenhower-era trailer, complete with an inflatable solar-heated shower unit.</p>
<p>&#8220;We brought an interest in high technology to the nomadic counterculture,&#8221; Lord observed.</p>
<p><strong>The Ant Farm completed a number of successful architectural commissions in the early &#8217;70s</strong>, including the award-winning House of the Century in Angleton, Texas. But the collective also spent time exploring the potential power of video and performance art.</p>
<p>This culminated in Media Burn, a dazzling event (captured on a widely distributed videotape) that featured two collective members dressed like astronauts, who drove a customized 1959 Cadillac El Dorado&#8212;outfitted with interior video communication&#8212;at full-speed through a pyramid of flaming TVs in the parking lot of San Francisco&#8217;s Cow Palace on July 4, 1975.</p>
<p>But perhaps the Ant Farm&#8217;s most famous endeavor was Cadillac Ranch, the art installation along Route 66 (now Highway 40) in Amarillo, Texas, that was immortalized in song by <strong>Bruce Springsteen</strong>.</p>
<p>Commissioned by Stanley Marsh 3, Lord and his Ant Farm partners partially buried 10 Cadillacs nose down in a wheat field--both celebrating the evolution of the Cadillac&#8217;s tailfin and at the same time mocking Detroit carmakers&#8217; history of planned obsolescence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cadillac was the ultimate status symbol in America at that time,&#8221; Lord noted. It took four weeks to find all the cars&#8212;some came from junkyards, a few came from used-car lots. But it took less than five days to bury them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Within six to eight months, images of Cadillac Ranch had appeared in <em>People</em> and <em>Esquire</em> magazines. Soon, articles began popping up everywhere and people began to make pilgrimages, often scratching their names in the paint of one of the cars.</p>
<p>Over the past three decades, the image of Cadillac Ranch has been used&#8212;with or without permission&#8212;by dozens of companies advertising everything from automobiles and insurance to restaurants and computers.</p>
<p>Possibly the best-known public artwork in the country, Cadillac Ranch is seen by an estimated 300,000 people each year as they motor down the Texas highway.</p>
<p>In 2004, Lord produced a DVD of Ant Farm material that was distributed nationally by Facets Multi-Media, and included Springsteen&#8217;s celebratory song, &#8220;Cadillac Ranch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After Springsteen wrote the song, his record company called and wanted to use a photo of Cadillac Ranch in the liner notes for his album <em>The River</em>,&#8221; Lord said. &#8220;We ended up giving them a photo for a very modest fee. So I wrote a letter to his manager asking for permission to use the song in the DVD, and they gave it to us.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>When a fire in their San Francisco studio destroyed much of their work</strong>, the Ant Farm disbanded in 1978. Lord eventually moved on to become an assistant professor of visual art at UC San Diego. He came to UCSC in 1988 and was chair of the Film and Digital Media Department from 2003-07.</p>
<p>Lord retired in 2010.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a hard transition for me after the Ant Farm ended,&#8221; Lord noted. &#8220;But I liked being in an environment of creative collaboration, so teaching appealed to me. The Ant Farm was my graduate education&#8212;my M.F.A. equivalency was established through life experience,&#8221; he added.</p>

Michael Berndt serves as student facilitator for the Carbon Fund.&#160;</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>In its first year, the student-run Carbon Fund became a major player in campus sustainability efforts, raising $180,000 to reduce UCSC&#8217;s carbon footprint.</p>
<p>Now the Carbon Fund has taken another big step forward. This campus-based environmental group&#8217;s selection committee has chosen nine staff and student projects for funding this year. Each successful applicant combines "green" philosophy with hard-nosed practicality.</p>
<p>"We&#8217;re very happy with the applications," said Carbon Fund chairman Cameron Fields, an environmental studies/economics double major with a minor in politics. Fields is also a Campus Climate Action intern.&#160;"We hope for an even stronger turnout during the next funding round."</p>
<p>Projects were selected from a pool of 13 applicants. Here are a few of this year&#8217;s highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>With help from a $12,000 Carbon Fund grant, undergraduates Grant Hartwell, Gabi Kirk and Lindsey Roark are launching a &#8220;Take Back The Tap&#8221; pilot program to turn some of UCSC&#8217;s drinking fountains into reusable bottle refill stations with push-back spigots similar to the ones used in fast-food restaurant soda fountains. The grant will fund the installation of refill stations at the UCSC Office of Physical Education, Recreation and Sports (OPERS) and several other places on campus, along with a community based-social marketing campaign.</li>
<li>The undergraduates Winfield Atherton and Lucy Ferneyhough, both part of the Impact Designs: Engineering and Sustainability Through Student Service internship (IDEASS) program, are installing a water-conservation system at Natural Bridges High School/Career Training Center on Swift Street in Santa Cruz. Their project includes a cistern and pipes to capture and channel rainfall to the school&#8217;s garden. They expect to finish the project in June. Atherton and Ferneyhough received $8,000 from the Carbon Fund for this project.</li>
<li>Tiffany Wise-West, a graduate student in the environmental sciences Ph.D. program, &#160;is supervising a team that will help make the historic Santa Cruz Municipal Wharf energy self-sufficient. A $15,000 Carbon Fund grant will help Wise-West&#8217;s team study the possibilities of wind and solar power on the half-mile-long wharf. A solar panel and wind turbine will be installed on a platform on the Wharf Headquarters roof, along with sensors that monitor wind and solar power. Wise-West recently received an Alumni Association Award at the Graduate Research Symposium for her presentation on this project.</li>
<li>Undergraduates Marine Richard and Abass Mohamed, &#160;both part of the UCSC Green Campus program, are launching projects to make lighting at the West Remote parking lot and the East Field House more energy efficient. The two projects received a total of $29,000.</li>
<li>An undergraduate-led project called PROPS (Program Recognizing Offices Practicing Sustainability) received $2,415 to help make campus staff offices more ecologically friendly through a certification program.&#160; The project includes energy audits, retrofitting light fixtures and power strips, changing faucets, and using eco-friendly paper and printers.&#160;</li>
<li>UCSC Arboretum staff will work with students and conservation groups on a plan to reduce water use throughout the region through educational programs and the sale of drought-tolerant plants. The Arboretum received $10,000 to fund the program.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each project is community-based, requiring cooperation between students, staff and community members. Stephen McCabe (Cowell, 1977),&#160;the UCSC Arboretum&#8217;s director of development and research, and curator of succulents, will work closely with students and conservation groups to help the public save water.</p>
<p>McCabe hopes the Arboretum project will save 740,000 gallons of water per year throughout the region, while reducing the consumption of gasoline and other petroleum projects used to deliver and purify water.</p>
<p>Participants will also encourage residents to plant trees efficiently. "It&#8217;s great to plant a tree, but if you plant it right under power lines, you have to prune it back with chainsaws for the next 20 years," McCabe said. "After a while, you consume so much energy that you more than offset the benefits of planting the tree in the first place."</p>
<p>The project coordinators will work closely with Cameron Fields, Lindsey Roark and John Michael Berndt of the Carbon Fund. Berndt serves as the fund&#8217;s student facilitator, while Roark handles outreach and publicity. Roark is also part of the "Take Back the Tap" team.</p>
<p>All recipients were asked to keep the project as transparent as possible by blogging updates about their progress at least once a month.</p>
<p>A Google document will help Fields, Berndt and Roark monitor each team&#8217;s progress and measure the total carbon reduction.</p>
<p>The Carbon Fund operates under the auspices of the UCSC Sustainability Office.</p>
<p>It uses money raised by Measure 44, a student-approved ballot initiative that raises money through a $3-per-quarter student fee.</p>
<p>The fee itself is not new; it has been in place since 2006, when students imposed a previous renewable energy ballot measure. Measure 44 simply redirects that money to the carbon fund.</p>
<p>"The great part is that everyone can spare three dollars a quarter so it doesn&#8217;t seem that big of a deal and it really has a huge impact," said Roark, a third-year student majoring in ecology&#160;and evolutionary biology.</p>
<p>The Carbon Fund committee is comprised of Patrick Testoni (UCSC Energy Manager), Daniel Press (ENVS department chair), Kate Cunningham (Staff from purchasing that focuses on sustainability), James Barsimantov (ENVS professor of the IDEASS class), Cameron Fields (CUIP and student), Nina Mautner (co-chair Student Environmental Center and student), Ben Oberhand ( Green Campus leader and student), Robert Singleton (SSITE chair and student)</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://sustainability.ucsc.edu/</url><title>Learn more about campus sustainability projects at UCSC</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="04640f0e80727046006b5488db686f49"><name>hammack-fellowship</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Psychology professor awarded prestigious Spencer fellowship</title><summary>Phillip L.

<p>In his new book, <em>Narrative and the Politics of Identity: The Cultural Psychology of Israeli and Palestinian Youth</em> (Oxford University Press, 2011), Phillip L. Hammack writes of his experiences working with Israeli and Palestinian teenagers who have attended peace-building workshops in the United States.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Hammack is an assistant professor of psychology at UC Santa Cruz and calls himself a "scholar-practitioner." He both worked for peace groups and spent several years interviewing young people from the Middle East who had returned to their homes after attending workshops that brought them face-to-face in Chicago and Maine.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>High hopes</strong></p>
<p>Hammack's hopes were high when he began the project a decade ago. As a graduate student he was researching the exposure to violence among inner-city African Americans in Chicago when the second intifada began among Palestinian youth in Israel and the occupied territories.<br/>
<br/>
At the time, his research had already begun to take more of an international focus. Hammack recalls seeing an opportunity to use his education and experience in an effort to help bridge the gulf of understanding between Palestinian and Israeli youth.<br/>
<br/>
He took an administrative position with Seeds of Peace, a group that brings young people to the United States for three weeks. Its slogan: "Treaties are negotiated by governments; Peace is made by people."&#160; The theory is known in psychology as the "contact approach" and has been deeply explored by UCSC emeritus professor Tom Pettigrew. The hope is that understanding and empathy can grow from conversation, mutual awareness, and shared experiences.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
"I was very optimistic," Hammack said, believing that it makes sense to work with younger people "before their attitudes hardened." What he discovered, however, contradicted his expectations and his hopes.</p>
<p><strong>Disturbing discoveries</strong></p>
<p>"What I found was very disturbing in terms of the efforts of these programs," he said. "It seems like a good idea, and contact can effectively reduce prejudice." But Hammack said his research found that the programs did not reduce prejudice among the Middle East youth or motivate them to pursue peace and nonviolence.<br/>
<br/>
His conclusions have not made him popular with the organizers of the peace groups where he formerly worked.<br/>
<br/>
Hammack got to know 45 teens from 2003-2007 as they participated in the programs and through follow-up interviews in their homes in Israel and the West Bank. He learned that despite a "halo effect" from getting to know one another the teens encountered resistance to their changed attitudes when they returned home.</p>
<p><strong>Ostracized by friends</strong></p>
<p>They were ostracized by their friends when they tried to communicate what they had learned. They "basically become a traitor to the national rhetoric," Hammack said. What's worse, he said, is that some teens react in turn by bending over backward to exhibit hostile attitudes in order to be accepted.<br/>
<br/>
As a psychologist, he attributes some of the attitude to adolescence and the teens' need to develop a strong sense of national identity, especially in conflict settings.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
He argues that the well-meaning programs that seek to bridge the gulf are "very American," designed to deal with multiculturalism and diversity. They are not designed to deal with the raw conflict that exists in the Middle East.<br/>
<br/>
Hammack has recently returned to Santa Cruz after a year as a visiting fellow at the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame.

The appointment, announced by campus provost and executive vice chancellor Alison Galloway, is effective July 1, when current dean Stephen Thorsett will assume a new post as president of Willamette University.<br/>
<br/>
Koch, an internationally recognized paleontologist, ecologist, and geochemist, joined the UCSC faculty in 1996 and has served as chair of the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences since 2006. He received the Charles Schuchert Award from the Paleontological Society in 1998 and is a fellow of the Paleontological Society and the Geological Society of America. <br/>
<br/>
"Chancellor Blumenthal and I are delighted with the appointment of Paul Koch as interim dean. He has considerable experience in academic administration, in addition to being an excellent teacher and researcher," Galloway said. <br/>
<br/>
Koch's research on the ecology and evolution of vertebrate animals often involves reconstruction of ancient ecosystems and climates to understand the environmental context in which prehistoric animals lived. His wide-ranging contributions include studies of the origin of primates and horses during a period of exceptional global warmth 55 million years ago, extinctions of large mammals in North America during the late Pleistocene Era, the transition from land to water in the ancestors of whales and other marine mammals, and the ecology of modern animals such as African lions, lemurs, bears, sharks, and seals. He has done field work in North and South America, Asia, Africa, and Antarctica.<br/>
<br/>
Koch earned his B.A. in geology and English at the University of Rochester and his M.S. and Ph.D. in geological sciences from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. <br/>
<br/>
The Division of Physical and Biological Sciences, with nine departments and more than a half-dozen institutes and research units, offers a broad range of programs, including 18 undergraduate degrees and 11 graduate training programs. In round numbers, the division has about 150 faculty members, 250 researchers, 450 graduate students, and 4,000 undergraduates. It has helped UCSC grow into a major research institution, while holding on to the campus's traditional strengths--a multidisciplinary approach to asking and answering questions and an innovative approach to undergraduate education.<br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0a6b039680727046012375a3d5e816aa"><name>galloway-koch</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Appointment of Interim Dean of the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences</title><summary>Paul Koch has been appointed interim dean of the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences, effective July 1.</summary><start-date>1305792000000</start-date><display-name>galloway-koch</display-name><path>/2011/05/galloway-koch</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/05/galloway-koch</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1305844843291</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1305844893713</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>It is a pleasure to announce the appointment of an interim dean of the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences.

<br/>
Aizenman, professor and director of the economics Ph.D. program at UCSC, expects Europe, led by France and Germany, to push for another European to lead the IMF to succeed Dominique Strauss-Kahn who faces sexual assault charges in New York. A leading candidate is Christine Lagarde, France's finance minister. If selected she would be the first woman to lead the international finance group since it was founded in the late 1940s.<br/>
<br/>
The IMF monitors the global financial system, watching exchange rates and balancing payments in an effort to ensure a global stability. It helped facilitate the $136 billion bailout last year for Greece and a $32 billion loan to Ireland. In the days before Strauss-Kahn&#8217;s arrest, finance ministers working with the IMF were discussing a substantial bailout for cash-strapped Portugal, and another payment to Greece.<br/>
<br/>
Traditionally, the head of the IMF has been a European while the head of the World Bank, the IMF's sister organization, has been an American, a "cozy relationship," Aizenman said.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Lagarde is the candidate who "may generate the best chance of continuation of the present direction of the IMF," said Aizenman, who has consulted with the international organization. But her selection will also "continue the built-in tensions with emerging markets," he said.<br/>
<br/>
"It touches a deeper issue within the IMF," he said, explaining that over the past decade more than half of the world's global economic activity and net savings have come from emerging economies. "Emerging markets are getting greater recognition and more power," he said. "Now they hope for an opportunity to assert a greater role."<br/>
<br/>
Ironically, it was Strauss-Kahn's selection as IMF managing director in 2007 that has opened the organization to fresh thinking and new ideas that include giving developing countries more clout, Aizenman said.<br/>
<br/>
Strauss-Kahn, the former French finance minister, presided over a turnaround of the IMF&#160; in the four years he served as managing director after initially laying off 400 staffers.<br/>
<br/>
The economic crisis of 2008-2009 both hastened the relative decline of the United States and Europe and raised the profile of emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China, said Aizenman, who leaves for China Friday to give a keynote address and talk with local economists. "It's fair to say that winner of the crisis are emerging market and developing countries."<br/>
<br/>
Another winner was the IMF itself. The economic crisis in the U.S. and Europe and its global repercussions made the IMF relevant again, and Strauss-Khan took the initiative to admit mistakes of the past, particularly around heavily criticized actions during the Asian currency crisis in 1997-1998.<br/>
<br/>
Strauss-Kahn "generated a new direction for the IMF that departed from its history," Aizenman said. "He understood the importance of having more resources and was very successful in raising them. The beginning of his term, 2007, was the time of declining morale at the IMF, then by the stroke of history the crisis came, and the IMF made a major U-turn."<br/>
<br/>
"One of the beneficiaries of the crisis of 2008-2009 is indeed the IMF," Aizenman said.<br/>
<br/>
Strauss-Kahn was able to boost expendable funds by more than $500 billion and led negotiations aiming at stabilizing countries during the global crisis.&#160; The IMF extended loans supporting adjustment and stabilization packages, facilitating countries to adjust to the losses associated with the crisis.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, Aizenman said he expects emerging markets to make a push for one of their own but not a very hard push. One possible compromise candidate is Kemal Dervis, a former Turkish finance minister who helped secure a multibillion-dollar IMF loan to rescue Turkey in 2001. Turkey is geographically close to Europe and has had aspirations to join the EU [European Union], he said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0a9dde5580727046012375a394833559"><name>measure-43</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz students reap the benefits of Measure 43</title><summary>This month marks the one-year anniversary of the passage of Measure 43, the student-funded Sustainable Food, Health, and Wellness Initiative at UC Santa Cruz that has treated thousands of students to a broad menu of ways to learn about food, including workshops, campus conferences, events, and classes. </summary><keywords>ucsc, uc santa cruz, farm, farm &amp;

presentations by well-known food policy activists.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Students&#8217; interest in more programming and opportunities related to gardening, nutrition, and the food system has been growing on campus for the past decade,&#8221; said Tim Galarneau, of UCSC&#8217;s Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS), who coordinates Measure 43 activities. &#8220;Last year that interest crystallized in the Measure 43 initiative, which was designed to engage UCSC undergraduates in learning about all aspects of food production and the food system.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
In May 2010, students turned out in record numbers to support the measure that adds a $3.75 fee per student each quarter.&#160;&#160; CASFS administers the approximately $106,000 generated each year and underwrites the cost of classes, grants and programs that enhance students&#8217; understanding of nutrition, farming and gardening, and the impacts of their food choices.<br/>
<br/>
"The fact that students decided to tax themselves in these difficult economic times so that they could learn more about sustainable food systems is remarkable. It demonstrates how hungry students are for knowledge and experience in food systems and how central sustainability is to UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; said Patricia Allen, director of CASFS.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Support for classes, recreation programs</strong></p>
<p>In its first year, Measure 43 supported a suite of hands-on learning opportunities at the CASFS/UCSC Farm and Alan Chadwick Garden. Students took part in a week-long intensive organic gardening class dubbed &#8220;Garden Cruz,&#8221; taught by CASFS Apprenticeship staff and graduates, as well as weekend classes on fruit tree care, seed starting, soil care, herbal and medicinal plants, and bee keeping.<br/>
<br/>
&#160;&#8220;I signed up for Garden Cruz because I wanted to learn how to grow my own food,&#8221; said Aliesha Balde, an environmental studies and economics major who spent her spring break week learning to garden.&#160; &#8220;What I learned was timeless,&#8221; she said. &#8220;These are skills I will have for the rest of my life."<br/>
<br/>
Along with gardening classes, Measure 43 helps fund the quarterly Food System Learning Journeys offered through the OPERS&#8217; Recreation Program. Fall and winter journeys included a tour of the campus gardens, a bay area urban garden and farmer&#8217;s market excursion, seasonal cooking lessons, and a visit to Cabrillo&#8217;s new horticulture facilities.<br/>
<br/>
This spring, students learned to can and pickle fruits and vegetables from the owners of Happy Girl Kitchen, helped plant an organic garden at Wilder Ranch State Park, biked the coast on a &#8220;tasting tour&#8221; of local farms and farm stands, and visited the Old Town Salinas Farmers Market and the Agriculture and Land-Based Training Association (ALBA), whose farmers provide UCSC with local, organic product for the dining halls.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Student grant funding available</strong></p>
<p>For students interested in developing new research and campus activities, Measure 43 provides funds for nutrition, health, and garden- and farm-based learning projects. This winter more than $25,000 was distributed to UCSC undergraduates in the first year of what is slated to be an annual competitive grants process.<br/>
<br/>
The measure will support student garden projects at Stevenson College and Family Student Housing, a Chancellor&#8217;s Undergraduate Intern position with the Program in Community and Agroecology (PICA), an urban agriculture demonstration project at The Village, and a &#8220;Take Back the Tap&#8221; initiative to reduce the use of single-use plastic bottles on campus.<br/>
<br/>
Throughout the academic year, students can also apply for Measure 43 funding to support visiting speakers and researchers. This year that support brought Winona LaDuke and Robert Gottlieb to campus for public presentations and meetings with students. Duke is a well-known food system activist and former vice presidential candidate; Gottlieb recently co-authored the book <em>Food Justice</em> and is director of the Urban and Environmental Policy Institute (UEPI) at Occidental College in Los Angeles. The funding also supported classroom presentations by author Richard Oppenlander at the Education for Sustainable Living speaker series, as well as talks by CASFS staff in several courses at UCSC.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Support for on-campus events</strong></p>
<p>A number of major on-campus events benefited from Measure 43 support this year: the Sustainable Food Interactive tent at the OPERS Fall Festival, the fall Harvest Festival and the recent Strawberry and Justice Festival at the CASFS/UCSC Farm, where hundreds of students enjoyed free strawberries and tamales, live music, and a panel on many of the issues surrounding the strawberry growing industry. Patricia Allen described the festival as, &#8220;The ideal type of event, with diverse campus groups getting together to discuss crucial food-system issues, learn about sustainability, and have fun all at the same time.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Measure 43 also subsidized the registration costs of dozens of UCSC students attending the annual "Strengthening the Roots: Food, Justice, &amp; Fair Trade Convergence," which attracted more than 350 high school and college students from 50 California schools. Held annually at UCSC, &#8220;The conference provides hands-on learning, skill sharing, and a deeper understanding of how to improve the food system,&#8221; said Galarneau. &#8220;The students who take part are emerging leaders who are working to change the food system here on campus and across the state.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Other projects funded by the measure include the annual <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/10/campus-food-guide.html"><em>Campus Food Guide</em> and <em>Campus Garden Guide</em></a>. More than 15,000 copies of the publications are distributed across campus each year and are part of the packets of all incoming residential students, introducing the student community to the classes, internships, and other opportunities to get involved in the campus and community gardens and food system.<br/>
<br/>
Reflecting on the first year of the measure&#8217;s efforts, UCSC history major Andrew Whitman&#8212;who helped run the successful Measure 43 campaign&#8212;said, &#8220;Measure 43 has had a tremendous impact on UCSC students&#8212;it really engages students in an experiential way. Any student at UCSC now has the opportunity to create their own project and receive funding to further their education.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
In the coming year, Whitman and other student leaders will work with Galarneau to promote more sponsorship and grant opportunities for students to develop their own projects and bring speakers to campus, along with more hands-on classes and Food Systems Learning Journeys.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;We want to connect the dots of what&#8217;s on our plates, shelves, and pantries to the people who work in challenging conditions to provide our food, as well as the resources and impacts associated with its production and distribution,&#8221; said Galarneau. &#8220;This is no easy task, but the collaboration and creative energy going into Measure 43 programs are already showing great promise.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://casfs.ucsc.edu/farm-to-college/measure-43-opportunities-2</url><title>List of student projects funded by Measure 43</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://casfs.ucsc.edu</url><title>Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems site</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/10/campus-food-guide.html</url><title>Information on Student Garden Guide, Canpus Food Guide</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0df641fd80727046012375a34918825b"><name>tiecon-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>TiE Service Award recognizes UCSC entrepreneurship</title><summary>UCSC was honored with a TiE Service Award for efforts to promote entrepreneurship.</summary><keywords>TiE, TiEcon</keywords><start-date>1305878400000</start-date><display-name>TiE Service Award</display-name><path>/2011/05/tiecon-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/05/tiecon-award</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1305904300442</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1305904422537</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/05/images/tiecon-award-550.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/05/images/tiecon-award-550.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tiecon-award-550.jpg</name><display-name>tiecon-award-550.jpg</display-name><file-size>110765</file-size><width>550</width><height>313</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/05/images/tiecon-award-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/05/images/tiecon-award-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tiecon-award-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>tiecon-award-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>28757</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>At TiEcon 2011, Steve Bourdow, director of development for the Baskin School of Engineering, holds the TiE Service Award plaque awarded to UCSC for efforts to promote entrepreneurship.

<br/>
The Whyte Distinguished Career Award is given annually to one or two individuals who have made notable contributions to sociological practice and public sociology. It is scheduled to be presented in August at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Association in Las Vegas.<br/>
<br/>
Pettigrew, an internationally renowned expert on racism and intergroup relations, has continued to lead a distinguished research career since retiring from UCSC in 1994. In 2009, he received the University of California Constantine Panunzio Distinguished Emeriti Award given for accomplishments since retirement.<br/>
<br/>
He is the author of a new book, <em>When Groups Meet: the Dynamics of Intergroup Contact</em> (Psychology Press, 2011), written with Linda Tropp, a former UCSC graduate. Pettigrew and Tropp's book is the first meta-analysis to synthesize research on conflict between groups -- racial, ethnic, religious, regional, economic, and social.</p>
<p>In 2008, Pettigrew won the <a href="http://socialsciences.ucsc.edu/support-us/awards-and-fellowships/dis-soc-sci-emeriti-faculty-award/index.html ">Distinguished Social Sciences Emeriti Faculty Award</a>.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1d806dad80727046012375a3a2fb71eb"><name>berman-award</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Vaccine expert Phillip Berman named finalist for Health Care Heroes Award </title><summary>The Silicon Valley Business Journal has named vaccine expert Phillip Berman a finalist for the 2011 Health Care Heroes Award.</summary><keywords>Phillip Berman, Health Care Heroes, Silicon Valley Business Journal</keywords><start-date>1306137600000</start-date><display-name>Health Care Heroes Award </display-name><path>/2011/05/berman-award</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/05/berman-award</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1306165013807</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1306165128494</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/05/images/phil-berman-200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/05/images/phil-berman-200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>phil-berman-200.jpg</name><display-name>phil-berman-200.jpg</display-name><file-size>48424</file-size><width>200</width><height>244</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/05/images/phil-berman-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/05/images/phil-berman-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>phil-berman-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>phil-berman-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>26559</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Phillip Berman</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The <em>Silicon Valley/San Jose Business Journal</em> has named UC Santa Cruz vaccine expert Phillip Berman a finalist for the 2011 Health Care Heroes Award in the "Research and Innovation" category. Berman, the Baskin Professor of biomolecular engineering, is a pioneer in the development of vaccines for AIDS and other infectious diseases.</p>
<p>Berman and the other finalists for the Health Care Heroes Awards will be profiled in the June 3 issue of the <em>Business Journal</em> and honored at an awards ceremony on Thursday, June 2, at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View.</p>
<p>Berman joined the faculty of UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering in 2006 after nearly 25 years of experience in the biotechnology industry. At UCSC, he is continuing his work on the development of a vaccine to prevent HIV infection. Berman invented the AIDSVAX vaccine while at Genentech in the 1990s and later cofounded VaxGen, a company focused on clinical development of this vaccine. As head of research and development at VaxGen, he oversaw the first two large-scale clinical trials of AIDSVAX, which failed to show efficacy.</p>
<p>Later, AIDSVAX was combined with another experimental vaccine (ALVAC, produced by Sanofi Pasteur) in the RV 144 trial, involving 16,000 adult participants in Thailand. The combined approach was designed to stimulate both cellular and antibody-based responses by the immune system, whereas previous vaccines stimulated just one or the other. The results, announced in 2009, showed that this vaccination strategy was safe and 31 percent effective in preventing new HIV infections. It was the first AIDS vaccine trial to show promising results and, coming after many disappointments, it led to renewed faith in the possibility of an effective AIDS vaccine.</p>
<p>Berman's current AIDS vaccine research is funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health totaling about $6.5 million. The focus of this research is on antibodies that are capable of neutralizing a wide range of HIV strains. Such "broadly neutralizing antibodies" are necessary to stop the virus because HIV is extremely variable, constantly evolving to evade the immune systems of infected individuals.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1e59c44480727046012375a3c09a217a"><name>business-plan-winners</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Business Design Competition:  high-tech test-grading system designers win top prize</title><summary>UCSC engineering graduate student Paul Abumov and McMaster University astrophysics graduate Nicolas Petitclerc won the top spot at this year's Business Design Competition.

<p>The competition is so fierce that the winner must have a clear, competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Such was the case for <a href="http://www.quaest.org/">Quaest</a>, this year&#8217;s winning team, consisting of Paul Abumov, a UCSC engineering graduate student, and Nicolas Petitclerc, who has a Ph.D. in physics and astronomy from McMaster University.</p>
<p>The team did more than impress the judges with their big idea -- a scanning and digital recognition technology designed to grade visual or "open-ended" test responses. Their product helps free teachers from the constraints of multiple-choice response forms like Scantron.</p>
<p>Center for Entrepreneurship director Dan Heller said the team has another, decisive edge that put them over the top: their idea is protected. A patent application for their product has already been filed and is considered pending.</p>
<p>"Many times, if you don&#8217;t have a patent to protect you in the beginning, even if you come up with a great idea, someone else will try to do it cheaper, better, faster than you can," Heller said.</p>
<p>"This is the most important aspect of running this (entrepreneurship) program inside UCSC," Heller continued. "Because of the weight of the UC system, it is much more difficult to infringe upon the patent. You need to have the 800-pound gorilla standing in the middle of the room, and that is what the UC system represents."</p>
<p>Their patent status helped sway a distinguished panel of judges, including Mike Frumkin, senior director of engineering at Google; Subhas Desa, a UCSC technology and information management lecturer; Ross Johnson, chief executive officer of DiskCorp; and Steve Bach, chief financial officer of DiskCorp.</p>
<p>The award is a career changer, said Abumov, who has been thinking about getting an engineering job. Instead he&#8217;ll work hard to make his fledgling business a success. "It&#8217;s going to take some effort to bring this up to speed."</p>
<p>This annual event is part of a curriculum that encourages students to build teams, and collaborate with other scholars from various disciplines. The goal is to build a potential business around an innovation, including a new or proposed technology.</p>
<p>Heller manages the competition along with economics lecture Mary Flannery and organizational management lecturer Kathi Lovelace.</p>
<p>The participants took a voluntary extracurricular class that met weekly at the UCSC campus, enabling them to brainstorm business ideas, create presentations to attract team members, then mold and shape their ideas into business models.</p>
<p>Flannery enjoyed watching the projects take shape during the classes.</p>
<p>"The thinking became a lot more clear,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s important for them to examine the market, and make sure that what they are thinking about the market is really true."</p>
<p>She was struck by the number of younger students who entered the competition this year. "We&#8217;re trying to develop a culture of entrepreneurship, to have students thinking that way throughout their college career."</p>
Last year&#8217;s winner was A Cappella Records, which champions, promotes, and distributes the music of all-vocal ensembles.&#160;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/05/c4e-established.html</url><title>UCSC launches new Center for Entrepreneurship</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.quaest.org</url><title>The Quaest website</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="1e9b82ae80727046012375a3c0ac42b2"><name>parking-permit</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Time to Renew Parking Permits and Metro Bus Passes</title><summary>It is time for staff and faculty to renew or purchase parking permits and Metro bus passes for 2011-12.</summary><keywords>parking permits</keywords><start-date>1306137600000</start-date><display-name>renew your parking permits</display-name><path>/2011/05/parking-permit</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/05/parking-permit</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1306183565889</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1306183565889</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><span>It is time for staff and faculty to renew or purchase parking permits and Metro bus passes for 2011-12.

<br/>
While permit pricing will remain the same next year, significant changes to the C permit have been made. C permits used to be issued by zone, according to college affiliation. With recent changes in campus housing (e.g., the transfer community at Porter), your on-campus residence may not be near your college. TAPS has reconfigured the C permit to be more responsive to the current changes in campus housing. More information about C permits can be found on the TAPS web site at <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://taps.ucsc.edu/undergradpermits.html">http://taps.ucsc.edu/undergradpermits.html</a>. <br/>
<br/>
Please keep in mind that certain types of permits do sell out. Applying now will increase your chance of getting the permit you want. You can also avoid waiting in line next fall if you request that your permit be mailed to you. We mail student permits out beginning the last week of August and through the first week of September. To receive your permit by mail during that two-week window, be sure to select "Mail To Permanent Address" in the Delivery and Display Options section of the application. Otherwise, you can pick your permit up when you arrive on campus in September. <br/>
<br/>
If you're considering whether you need a car on campus, check out Zipcar, UCSC's car-sharing program. Students 18 and over can rent cars on an hourly or daily basis. Members have access to eleven vehicles -- nine on campus and two in downtown Santa Cruz, 24 hours per day. For detailed information, visithttp://www.zipcar.com/ucsc/ <br/>
<br/>
If you choose to drive your car to campus, consider sharing your ride. Zimride, a ride-matching program that is exclusive to the UCSC community, makes it easy to find other students who want to carpool. By carpooling, you can reduce your carbon footprint and save on expenses, including the cost of an "R" or "C" Carpool parking permit.

<br/>
The UCSC alumnus is just one of many graduates of the campus who will participate in panel discussions and screenings at the event&#8212;exploring such topics as <strong>Documentary Films &amp; Media/Social Change</strong>, <strong>So What is Film Education?</strong>, <strong>The&#160;Business of Film</strong>, and <strong>Getting Started in Television</strong>.&#160;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Beggs graduated from UC Santa Cruz with honors in 1989 with a double-major in politics and theater arts.<br/>
<br/>
As president of Lionsgate television, he is responsible for development and production of all scripted and non-scripted programming for both domestic and international distribution.</p>
<p>He is also head of the company&#8217;s feature-length documentary unit.<br/>
<br/>
Lionsgate&#8217;s roster includes the recently announced drama series <strong><em>Boss</em></strong> starring Kelsey Grammer; the award-winning AMC hit <strong><em>Mad Men</em></strong>; <strong><em>Weeds</em></strong>, starring Mary-Louise Parker; <strong><em>Nurse Jackie</em></strong>, starring Edie Falco; and <strong><em>Running Wilde</em></strong> starring Will Arnett and Keri Russell.<br/>
<br/>
Beggs first gained prominence in television as a producer on the series <em>Baywatch</em> and was tapped in 1998 to start Lionsgate&#8217;s series television business. He has since led the expansion of the company&#8217;s television production activities in both broadcast and cable.<br/>
<br/>
Other featured alumni guests at the UCSC Film Symposium will include: <strong>Rick Carter</strong> production designer (<em>Sucker Punch, Avatar</em>); <strong>Ron Yerxa</strong> producer,&#160;Bona Fide Productions (<em>Little Miss Sunshine, Little Children, Election</em>); <strong>Tad Leckman</strong> (visual effects designer (Escape Studios/ Industrial Light &amp; Magic); <strong>Sarah Schechter</strong> Senior Vice President, Production--Warner Brothers; <strong>Marc Smolowitz</strong> new media producer/director&#160;(<em>The Weather Underground &amp; Trembling Before G-d</em>); <strong>James Stanton</strong> television editor (<em>Mega Quake, Undercover Boss, America's Got Talent</em>); <strong>Tiffany White</strong> assistant costume designer/costumer (<em>Mad Men, True Blood</em>); <strong>Dylan Wilcox</strong> Head of Acquisitions Focus Features,&#160;Universal International; <strong>Stuart Sender</strong> producer/director (<em>Harmony, Beyond "JFK" &#8211; The Question of Conspiracy</em>); <strong>Joe Sheridan</strong> web writer (<em>Ellen Show</em>); and <strong>Davey Holmes</strong> writer/producer (<em>The Chicago Code, Pushing Daisies</em>).<br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#8220;Considering the size and age of our film program, it is impressive how many of our alumni are successful in the film and TV industry,&#8221; noted David Yager, arts dean at UC Santa Cruz.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;They are all very excited about returning to UCSC,&#8221; Yager added. &#8220;In every case when I have talked to these alumni, they have remarked how their education at UCSC has changed their lives and played an important role in their career success.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
The festivities kick off on Friday evening at 5 p.m. with a reception and screening honoring emeritus UCSC film and digital media professor <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/05/chip-lord-film.html">Chip Lord, co-founder of the Ant Farm</a> in 1968--a groundbreaking, experimental art and architecture collective that showcased the potential power of video and performance art.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday features a day of film screenings and panel discussions with alumni professionals working in film, television and digital media, along with faculty from UCSC&#8217;s Film and Digital Media Department.<br/>
<br/>
Beggs will deliver the keynote address at 5 p.m. at UCSC&#8217;s Media Theater, with additional film screenings beginning later that evening at 8:15 p.m.<br/>
<br/>

<p>Many of these students labor outside the public eye, whether they are rehearsing a play or piece of music, drafting a paper, or completing an in-depth research project.</p>
<p>This week allows these students to present their work in highly public settings, from an annual print sale to a sciences and engineering poster symposium.</p>
<p>Every year, a large crowd attends the Undergraduate Academic Achievement and &#8232;Excellence in Teaching Awards, which will be held from 3 to 5 p.m<strong>.,</strong> June 3, &#8232;at the <a href="http://maps.ucsc.edu/cdcollegeNineTenMulti.html">Colleges Nine and Ten, Multipurpose Room</a>.</p>
<p>One of the highlights is the Steck Family Award, which honors the best senior thesis completed during the academic year. The winner is chosen from the Chancellor's Award candidates. In keeping with UCSC tradition, the identity of the winner will remain a secret until the end of the ceremony.</p>
<p>Outstanding faculty&#160;will also receive recognition: The Excellence in Teaching Awards are given each spring to selected faculty who engage students through innovative course designs, special learning techniques and materials, and their own personal qualities as teachers and mentors.</p>
<p>The Physical &amp; Biological Sciences Division has a highly public event of its own &#8211; the <a href="http://pbsci.ucsc.edu/news-events/events/2011-6-02.html">14th Annual Undergraduate Research Poster Symposium</a>, which recognizes and promotes the outstanding undergraduate research that is being carried out at UCSC while providing students with the experience of presenting their research results in a professional setting. It is sponsored by the Division of Physical &amp; Biological Sciences and the Jack Baskin School of Engineering.&#160; The free event will be held at the Jack Baskin Engineering Courtyard Thursday, June 2, 2:00-4:00 pm.</p>
<p>Art exhibits take place throughout Student Achievement Week. Recipients of the Irwin Scholarship will exhibit their work from May 25 to June 11 during the <span>Irwin Scholars Exhibition</span> at the Sesnon Gallery, Porter College. The opening reception will take place May 25, 5:00-7:00 pm.</p>

<p>Judging from the last few years, the&#160; <a href="http://artsites.ucsc.edu/printsale/">37th Annual UCSC Student Print Sale</a> should be well-attended. The annual event takes place at the Baskin Visual Arts Center, Room G-101, Friday, June 3 and Saturday, June 4, from 10:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m. This is a chance to buy original fine-art prints in a variety of media: woodcut, lithography, etching, digital printmaking and handmade books, courtesy of the printmaking program and facilities at UCSC.

screen final video projects</article-subhead><article-text><p>Soon-to-be graduates of the <a href="http://socdoc.ucsc.edu/">Social Documentation (Soc Doc) program</a> at UC Santa Cruz will premiere their masters thesis video documentaries at the Del Mar Theater in Santa Cruz, Thursday, June 9 at 7 p.m.&#160; The screening is free and open to the public.<br/>
<br/>
This is the fifth annual Soc Doc Graduate Exhibition and the second to be showcased at the Del Mar Theater. This year the screening moves to the large downstairs theater after last year's full house resulted in many attendees being turned away.<br/>
<br/>
"The work you will see, hear, and experience is the culmination of an intense two years as our students immersed themselves in documentary traditions and craft, scholarly research and analysis, and storytelling," said Renee Tajima-Pe&#241;a, professor and graduate director of the Social Documentation program.<br/>
<br/>
Tajima-Pe&#241;a also announced that beginning next fall, the masters program will join the <a href="http://film.ucsc.edu/">Film and Digital Media department</a> in the <a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/">Arts Division</a>. It has been part of the Community Studies department in the Social Sciences division since it was founded in 2005.<br/>
<br/>
The exhibition this year features six video documentaries. In addition, one student, Bridgette Auger, has a photography exhibition at the <a href="http://www.michaelangelogallery.net/">Michaelangelo Gallery</a>, 1111-A River St., Santa Cruz, June 3 &#8211; 26, with an opening reception on Friday, June 3.<br/>
<br/>
<strong><em>ElShelleh (The Guys)</em></strong><br/>
In her photo-based video documentary, Auger follows four Iraqi refugees, all friends, as they search for direction and purpose in their new home in El Cajon. Photographs, voices, and music reveal the personal histories and current struggles of Ahmed, Jack, Tommy and Fadi.&#160; When not working in dead-end jobs, the guys get together to cook, play music, and sustain each other as they try their best to find a way to move forward in a country that regards them with suspicion, fear, pity, and resentment.<br/>
<br/>
<em><strong>Whistlin&#8217; Dixie: Queer Sounds, New South</strong></em><br/>
Meredith Heil takes a road trip to the South in search of musicians like the Butchies, Midtown Dickens, Street Poet, Humble Tripe, Amy Ray and Melissa York -- members of a new generation of queer activists who spend their nights creating independent music, promoting acceptance, and celebrating queer visibility amid confederate flags and pop country radio.&#160;&#160; Along the way, she investigates the complex historical relationship between Southern music, identity politics, and resistance.<br/>
<br/>
<em><strong>The Unique Ladies</strong></em><br/>
Gloria Mor&#225;n focuses on an all-women&#8217;s lowrider car club in San Diego. Despite a constant struggle to keep their club alive, Sherry Yafuso and Pat Guitierrez manage to make it to their fifth year. Now the ladies are ready to expand. Only the summer&#8217;s final car show can prove whether these women can handle the driver&#8217;s seat.<br/>
<br/>
<em><strong>Paved With Good Intentions</strong></em><br/>
In Nepal&#8217;s gorgeous Kathmandu Valley, sand translates into social status. Natalie Rold<br/>
follows the sand from illegal mining in the Bagmati River Basin to its transformation into cement for the construction of middle-class housing developments in Pepsi-Cola Town Planning. Along the way she finds a complex and conflicted relationship between eco-development, tourism and the rights of the landless and refugee sand-miners living along the river.<br/>
<br/>
<em><strong>My Fa&#8217;aSamoa</strong></em><br/>
In her personal documentary, Ursula Siataga examines the notion of <em>Fa&#8217;aSamoa</em> (the Samoan Way of Life) as it is contested, forgotten, and remembered in the lives of her boisterous multi-generational family.&#160; Siataga&#8217;s grandparents arrived in San Francisco during the great wave of migration in the 1950s.&#160; The film is a "memoryscape" prompted by her grandmother&#8217;s last days. It focuses on the tension with a new generation, changing times, and the troubled history of Siataga&#8217;s sister Gaynor, whose life has been torn between <em>Fa&#8217;aSamoa</em> and the streets.<br/>
<br/>
<strong><em>Abaayo/Sister</em></strong><br/>
Kate Trumbull follows best friends Maryam and Roda who grew up in San Diego after being orphaned and displaced by civil war in Somalia. Caught in a cultural tug-of-war and bonded by the loss of their parents, they are on the verge of adulthood when unexpected news of eviction, only two weeks before Ramadan, shocks them and tests the bonds of their friendship. As they decide to move to a new city, old memories of war and loss reappear along with the threat of separation.<br/>
<br/>
The Social Documentation Program at UC Santa Cruz is an innovative, two-year graduate-level program leading to a Master of Arts degree. It provides students with a chance to develop expertise in various documentary media, including film and video, audio, photography, and digital media.<br/>
<br/>
Soc Doc taps faculty from throughout the UCSC campus to provide students with access to expertise across traditional disciplines. Soc Doc graduates have earned grants and awards for their thesis documentaries in film/video, photography, and digital media. More information is available on the Social Documentation Program at socdoc@ucsc.edu or 831-459-4706.<br/>
<br/>
The graduate exhibition is supported in part by the Social Sciences Office of the Dean, City of Santa Cruz Redevelopment Agency, Nickelodeon Theaters, Inc., and Michaelangelo Gallery.<br/>

Rita passed away Sunday, May 22, after a month-long hospitalization.</p>
<p>Rita was a dear friend who served the campus in her official capacity as associate to the chancellor from 1991 to 1996. During her tenure, she was a warm and welcoming ambassador for UCSC--both on campus and in the Santa Cruz community.</p>
<p>Many of you may also remember Rita for her passionate advocacy of students. She not only believed that students from all backgrounds deserved the chance to realize their potential at UC Santa Cruz, she generously supported that belief.</p>
<p>The UCSC Women's Club established the Rita Olsen Pister Endowed Scholarship for Re-Entry Students in recognition of her service and her lasting contributions to the campus. In 2009, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2009/02/2712.html">Rita and Karl were honored</a> at the annual Scholarship Benefit Dinner for their service and continued philanthropic support of the campus.</p>
<p>Memorial services for Rita will be private.</p>

<p>Nicole Paiement conducts a chamber ensemble of members of the UCSC Orchestra, plus student singers, in a fully staged production of Britten's 1947 opera.</p>
<p>Directed by Brian Staufenbiel,&#160; <em>Albert Herring</em> will be performed in the original English with supertitles.</p>
<p>Britten&#8217;s second chamber opera was composed just a year after its predecessor, <em>The Rape of Lucretia</em>. Yet the contrast in style and subject matter could not be greater.</p>
<p>Instead of a tragedy based on a tale from Roman antiquity, <em>Albert Herring</em> is a comic opera set in the imaginary East Suffolk town of Loxford at the turn of the 20th century.<br/>
<br/>
The score contains some of Britten&#8217;s wittiest musical invention, and his gifts for parody and caricature are given full reign. However, the work is far from being mere farce.</p>
<p>Albert is a sympathetic and credible figure who, tied to his mother&#8217;s apron-strings and frustrated by small-town pieties, embarks on a debauched &#8216;rake&#8217;s progress&#8217;, a theme fully in keeping with the composer&#8217;s favourite subject--the loss of innocence.</p>
<p><em>Albert Herring</em> premiered at Glybndebourne in 1947, conducted by the composer, with Peter Pears singing the title role. The opera was given its American premiere at Tanglewood later that year.</p>

<p>&#8220;The small, portable scoreboard is positioned directly across the field from where the guests sit, but it&#8217;s not ideal,&#8221; said Ryan Andrews, UCSC&#8217;s executive director of Student Engagement. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to have pretty good eyes. It just doesn&#8217;t feel right.&#8221;</p>
<p>This longstanding situation is about to change, thanks to a generous donation by Wells Fargo Bank, which is paying for the first permanent outdoor playing field scoreboard in campus history. The $15,000 scoreboard will be solar-powered and a much better fit for the 300 spectators that come to the men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s intercollegiate soccer matches.</p>
<p>Wells Fargo representative Michelle Bassi learned about the outdated scoreboard during a campus tour, following Wells Fargo&#8217;s initial sponsorship of the annual Scholarship Benefit Dinner. Several months later, she and other senior Wells Fargo representatives, including Jeff Oellerich and Alex Hughes, visited the site and approved the donation to pay for the scoreboard.</p>
<p>Workers will install the scoreboard in time for soccer matches that will be held on the field next fall.</p>
<p>The upcoming project is good news for the men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s soccer teams and for other sports groups that use the field, including rugby, Ultimate Frisbee, and various intramural teams.</p>
<p>The current portable scoreboard operates on a generator and must be hauled out for each match.</p>
<p>&#8220;It basically gives you the number of goals and the timing, and that&#8217;s it,&#8221; Andrews said. &#8220;We run a big extension cord to the generator.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new scoreboard will be 5 &#189; feet high and 16 feet across, or 7 times larger than the old one. The board will rest on seven-foot posts for optimal visibility. &#160;</p>
<p>The extension cord will no longer snake across the field; there will be no need for a generator.</p>

<div>It is with sadness that I write to inform you of the death of our colleague, Professor Greta Slobin. Those of us who knew her will remember her loyalty to her friends, her commitment to her family, and her understanding of the importance of irony. Greta's husband, Mark Slobin writes that "She carried on a long and valiant struggle over many years without yielding her pleasure in life, sustained by the extraordinarily wide and rich circle of [friends] that was her hallmark."<br/>
<br/>
Greta received a BA in French Language and Literature from Wayne State University, with a minor in Russian and Humanities, in 1966. She earned an MA in Slavic Language and Literature from the University of Michigan, with a minor French Literature, in 1970 and an M.Phil. in Slavic Language and Literature from Yale in 1975 and a Ph.D. in Slavic Languages and Literature from Yale University in 1978 with a dissertation titled, "A.M. Remizov and the Rise of Russian Modernism." &#160;Greta was appointed as an Assistant Professor of Russian Literature at UC Santa Cruz on July 1, 1988.&#160;She was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure on July 1, 1990 and to Full Professor on July 1, 2000.&#160;She retired on July 1, 2003. Before coming to Santa Cruz, Greta taught at Amherst College and Wesleyan University.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Among the many courses that Greta taught so successfully and to many devoted students are The Russian Avante Garde, Russian Literature after the Revolution, Tolstoy, East Central Europe 1945-89, 19th Century Russian Literature, The Brothers Karamozov, and East European Cinima Before and After the Fall. She was committed to building a strong Russian and Eastern European Studies program at UCSC.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>&#160;<br/>
Among her many awards and honors are an NEH Fellowship for work on "Literary Memoir After the Revolution" (1987-88), a research fellowship at the Russian Institute at Harvard University (1987-88), and appointment as a Visiting Scholar at the Harriman Institute at Columbia University (1996).<br/>
<br/>
Her publications include Remizov's Fictions: 1900-1921 (Northern Illinois University Press, 1991) and an edited volume entitled Postcommunism: Rethinking the Second World (1994), as well as many articles, book chapters, and reviews.<br/>
<br/>
The funeral is scheduled for Monday at 1 at Indian Hill Cemetery, Middletown. There will be a celebration of Greta's life in July, with details to follow.<br/>
<br/>
She has asked that any donations to be sent to:<br/>

The award is conferred in recognition of lifetime achievements in research, and recipients are invited to carry out research projects in cooperation with specialist colleagues in Germany.<br/>
<br/>
Gill said he plans to work with researchers at several institutions in Germany, starting with the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of Kiel (IFM-GEOMAR), which is the leading oceanographic research center in Germany. Gill's research focuses on volcanic activity on the seafloor and the formation of oceanic crust, as well as the origins of the continental crust. <br/>
<br/>
The Humboldt Foundation grants up to 100 Humboldt Research Awards annually, each valued at 60,000 euros.<br/>
<br/>
Gill was also honored recently by oceanographers who named a large submarine volcano after him. "Gill Volcano" was discovered and named by New Zealand oceanographers, who published their discovery last year. Located about 200 kilometers north of New Zealand's North Island, the volcano is about 6,000 feet high and 5 miles in diameter--about the size of Mount St. Helens--with a crater at the top. It is not known to be active but has not yet been explored, Gill said. <br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="32fa3bd880727046012375a33790434d"><name>dag-forum</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>June 3 Forum on Demonstration Response</title><summary>On Friday June 3, starting at 5:30 pm, a forum will be held at the Porter College Fireside Lounge (http://maps.ucsc.edu/wvportercollege3a.html) to give the Demonstration Advisory Group (DAG) an opportunity to hear from students about their experiences during  demonstrations on the UCSC campus.</summary><keywords>DAG, Demonstration Advisory Group</keywords><start-date>1306483200000</start-date><display-name>Forum on Demonstration Response</display-name><path>/2011/05/dag-forum</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/05/dag-forum</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1306525317848</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1306525426176</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>On Friday June 3, starting at 5:30 pm, a forum will be held at the Porter College Fireside Lounge (<a href="http://maps.ucsc.edu/wvportercollege3a.html">http://maps.ucsc.edu/wvportercollege3a.html</a>) to give the Demonstration Advisory Group (DAG) an opportunity to hear from students about their experiences during&#160; demonstrations on the UCSC campus. &#160;DAG members want to receive information directly from students about past campus protests &#8211; what they saw, what they experienced, any consequences to them because of&#160; their involvement in the event, etc. &#160;We are not interested in knowing what individual students did, and we will ask that no students be identified by name. &#160;We are interested in what students experienced in their interactions with campus officials.</span></p>
<p><span>DAG would like to have this information because we're reviewing campus policies and procedures, in part because we see problems with them. &#160;We want to be sure we hear from students about their concerns and receive their recommendations for how to revise current practices.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Attendance at the forum will be limited to students and members of the DAG only, in the hopes that people may speak frankly without concern about repercussions. &#160;Further, EVC Galloway ensures that neither any&#160; information you give at the meeting, nor your presence at it, will be given by any member of DAG to anyone in Student Affairs or the campus police, nor will would it ever be allowable in any judicial affairs procedure.</span></p>
<p><span>DAG is co-chaired by Alison Galloway (Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor) and Helen Shapiro (Provost of Colleges Nine and Ten). &#160;Information about DAG, a full list of members, and their contact information can be found at <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/04/dag.html">http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/04/dag.html</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>We realize that the timing is not ideal by any means. &#160;This forum will not be the last&#160; formal opportunity that students have to give input to DAG, but it will&#160; be the only formal opportunity this school year.&#160;</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Students</audience><admin>Allison Galloway, Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor; Helen Shapiro Provost, Colleges Nine and Ten</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4739c3bb80727046012375a343a6a5ac"><name>felicia-rice</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> Felicia Rice featured at Stanford's Cantor Arts Center</title><summary>Alumna Felicia Rice (Cowell '78)—now manager for UCSC’s Digital Arts and New Media M.F.A. program (DANM)—will be featured in The Art of the Book in California: Five Contemporary Presses, an exhibition at Stanford’s Cantor Arts Center.</summary><keywords>book arts, DANM, digital arts and new media, ucsc, uc santa cruz, Cantor Arts Center</keywords><start-date>1306864800000</start-date><display-name> Felicia Rice at Stanford Cantor Arts Center</display-name><path>/2011/05/felicia-rice</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/05/felicia-rice</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1306865025834</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1306866319168</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Art</value><value>Digital Arts and New Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/05/images/rice-250.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/05/images/rice-250.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rice-250.jpg</name><display-name>rice-250.jpg</display-name><file-size>41764</file-size><width>250</width><height>374</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/05/images/rice-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/05/images/rice-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>rice-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>rice-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21848</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Felicia Rice</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/05/images/Rice-Books-275.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/05/images/Rice-Books-275.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Rice-Books-275.jpg</name><display-name>Rice-Books-275.jpg</display-name><file-size>30173</file-size><width>275</width><height>238</height></image><image-alt/><image-caption>"Documentado/Undocumented," a work-in-progress with Guillermo Gomez-Pe&#241;a and UCSC faculty Jennifer Gonz&#229;lez, Gustavo Vazquez, and Zachary Watkins.</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Alumna Felicia Rice (Cowell '78)&#8212;now manager for UCSC&#8217;s Digital Arts and New Media M.F.A. program (DANM)&#8212;will be featured in <strong>The Art of the Book in California: Five Contemporary Presses</strong>, an exhibition running June 1 through August 28, at Stanford&#8217;s Cantor Arts Center.</p>
<p>A lifelong resident of the California coast, Rice came to Santa Cruz as a student at UCSC in 1974. Three years later, she established <a href="http://www.movingpartspress.com/">Moving Parts Press</a>&#160; and began her career as a printer, teacher, literary/fine arts publisher, and book artist.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a high honor to be selected for this exhibit&#8212;one of five California presses&#8212;when there are so many active book artists in the state,&#8221; said Rice.</p>
<p>&#8220;As e-books become more and more popular, these works represent one view of what the future holds for the book form,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Rice&#8217;s Moving Parts Press has been included in exhibitions and collections both nationally and internationally&#8212;from book shows in New York and Frankfurt to the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum.</p>
<p>"During the last 50 years, the conception and production of the book has evolved into an art form that exceeds all former standards,&#8221; noted Roberto G. Trujillo, head of Stanford Library's Department of Special Collections, which is lending works for the exhibition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Book arts have become a mature medium, and California artists and printers are leaders in the fine arts of the book,&#8221; Trujillo added.</p>
<p>The exhibition will present works by <strong>Foolscap Press</strong> (Peggy Gotthold and Lawrence G. Van Velzer) <strong>Moving Parts Press</strong> (Felicia Rice); <strong>Ninja Press</strong> (Carolee Campbell); Peter Koch Printers (Peter Rutledge Koch); and <strong>Turkey Press</strong> (Harry and Sandra Reese).</p>
<p>The Cantor Arts Center is located on the Stanford campus, off Palm Drive at Museum Way.</p>

<br/>
On June 3, three of those venues will showcase the work of UCSC student artists.<br/>
<br/>
The &#8220;2011 Creative Collective&#8221; at the R. Blitzer Gallery (in the former Wrigley Building) is an exhibition consisting of the work of eight students and five of the professors who have inspired them.<br/>
<br/>
The brainchild of graduating senior art student, Lili Arnold, the idea was to curate a student/faculty art show and also benefit the Santa Cruz community.<br/>
<br/>
Including a wide variety of work from photography to sculpture, the show&#8217;s sales and donations will be used to create a scholarship for two Santa Cruz high school students who have exhibited "amazing potential and passion for their craft."&#160;<br/>
<br/>
The goal: to inspire the next generation of artists in Santa Cruz.<br/>
<br/>
An opening reception kicks off the show on June 3rd, with music by The Coffis Brothers and the North Pacific String Band. The exhibition runs through the end of June.<br/>
<br/>
Featured artists include UCSC students and faculty Ken Alley, Lili Arnold, Jeffrey Cheung, Chris Cravey, Frank Galuszka, Deena Hashem, Miguel Libarnes, Garrett McGovern, Cody Pearce, Katie Perry, Paul Rangell, Julia Warner, and Richard Wohlfeiler.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Another stop on the June 3 tour</strong> is Santa Cruz&#8217; own Museum of Art and History, which is featuring an exhibition created by UCSC students called &#8220;Our Threads of Allegiance: World War II in Santa Cruz and Abroad.&#8221;</p>
<p>The exhibition celebrates the contributions of Santa Cruz citizens to the WWII relief effort, weaving together historical objects and personal stories to explore the relationship between local Santa Cruz citizens and those abroad during the war.</p>
<p>During First Friday, the exhibit will feature a special mock portrait studio (from 12-2 pm) where children are invited to dress-up in the attire of World War II and contribute their own tex "tile" to the Museum's growing visitor quilt.</p>
<p>Later that evening, a reception will take place from 5 to 9 pm, including live music, refreshments, and curator-led tours.</p>
<p><strong>And at the Cellar Door</strong> (328 Ingalls St), UCSC grads Samantha Suddaby, Sean Vranizan, and Will Kasten will also be showing their wares.<br/>
<br/>

<p>First, the budget. I want to thank principal officers across campus for their diligent work cutting their budgets as we've struggled to absorb the reductions required&#160;for the fiscal year that begins July 1. It has been a daunting process, and I appreciate their dedication.</p>
<p>After reviewing each proposal, I have made my final decisions and <a href="http://cpevc.ucsc.edu/files/2011-12BudgetAllocations5-27-11.pdf">informed campus leaders</a>. There is little good news to share, because meeting this challenge is requiring staff layoffs, elimination of unfilled faculty positions, and further reductions in instructional support, such as teaching assistants. I want to acknowledge the human toll of these cuts as we say good-bye to valued colleagues and friends. And clearly, the impact of these cuts will be felt by remaining employees, who will face the dual challenge of getting the work done with fewer resources &#8212; and deciding what will no longer be done at all.</p>
<p>As a result of this year's budget cuts and our ongoing commitment to our students, whose financial investment in their education is increasing, I propose that we work collaboratively toward five key student-focused goals. I am calling this effort "Five for 2015," in recognition of the upcoming 50th anniversary of this campus. These goals are:</p>
<p>&#8226; <strong>Four years or less</strong>: In collaboration with the Academic Senate, I want to examine and streamline major requirements to ensure that students can have a challenging and rewarding educational experience and can earn a degree &#8212; of which they and we will be proud &#8212; in four years or less.</p>
<p>&#8226; <strong><span>Increased retention</span></strong>: I want to improve UCSC's current student retention rate. Moving our overall rate will be a lengthy process, but we can aim in the short term to improve our first-year retention rates by 2 percent and to drop our upper-division attrition to below 10 percent.</p>
<p>&#8226; <strong>Increase nonresident student enrollment</strong>: A modest increase in the number of nonresident domestic and international students to 5 percent of total undergraduate enrollment, from current levels of about 3.5 percent, would diversify our student body and provide the campus with additional&#160;resources.</p>
<p>&#8226; <strong>Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI)</strong>: We already have a strong record of educating Latino/Latina students. HSI status would increase our visibility as a pipeline to college &#8212;&#160;<em>and beyond&#160;</em>&#8212; for all students from underrepresented groups.</p>
<p>&#8226; <strong>Financial stability</strong>: I want to be able to prepare a three-year budget with a reasonable expectation that it will be within 5 percent of the actual budget. This will benefit faculty and students by allowing us to map the curriculum and plan course availability with far greater certainty.</p>
<p>My focus on these deliberately<em>student</em>-oriented goals recognizes the impact budget cuts and tuition increases have had on students. Put simply, I believe these goals will help ensure that students get their "money's worth" and are able to make timely progress toward graduation.</p>
<p>In closing, I want to express my gratitude to all of the colleagues who have collaborated with me on this year's budget challenges. I also want to congratulate the <a href="http://events.ucsc.edu/commencement/">thousands of UCSC students who are about to graduate</a>, and to thank all the staff and faculty who have helped get them to this milestone. Go, Banana Slugs!</p>

<p>el 31 de Mayo, 2011</p>
<p>Para:&#160; La Comunidad de UCSC</p>
<p>De parte de:&#160; Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor, Alison Galloway</p>
<p>Sobre:&#160; Los recortes presupuestarios y los pr&#243;ximos pasos</p>
<p>Mientras nos dirigimos a toda velocidad en las ultimas semanas del trimester, quiero ponerle al d&#237;a sobre la situacion presupuestaria y anunciar iniciativas espec&#237;ficas que creo que se colocan el campus para el futuro.</p>
<p>En primer lugar,el presupuesto.&#160; Quiero dar las gracias a los funcionarios principales en todo el campus por su trabajo diligente cortando.sus presupuestos mientras hemos luchado para absorber las reducciones requeridas para el a&#241;o fiscal que comienza el primer de julio.&#160;&#160; Ha sido un proceso de enormes proporciones y les agradezco su dedicacion.</p>
<p>Despu&#233;s de revisar cada propuesta, he hecho mi decisi&#243;n final y les informe los <a href="http://www1.ucsc.edu/administration/evc/docs/2011-12BudgetAllocations%285-27-11%29.PDF"><span><span>dirigentes del campus</span></span></a>. Hay pocas buenas noticias que compartir, porque frente a este desaf&#237;o se requiere despidos de personal, eliminaci&#243;n de los cargos docentes vacantes, y reducciones adicionales en apoyo de instrucci&#243;n, tales como auxiliares docentes. Quiero reconocer el costo humano de estos recortes como nos decimos adi&#243;s a nuestras colegas valorados, y nuestros amigos.&#160; Y claramente, el impacto de estos recortes se dejar&#225;n sentir&#160; los empleados restantes, que se enfrentar&#225;n al doble reto de conseguir, haciendo el trabajo con menos recursos y decidiendo lo que ya no puede hacer nada.</p>
<p>Como resultado de recortes en el presupuesto de este a&#241;o y nuestro compromiso continuo con nuestros estudiantes, cuya inversi&#243;n financiera en su educaci&#243;n es cada vez mayor, propongo que trabajemos en colaboraci&#243;n hacia cinco objetivos clave centrado en el estudiante. Estoy llamando &#160;este esfuerzo &#8220;Cinco para 2015&#8221;, en reconocimiento de la celebraci&#243;n del pr&#243;ximo aniversario de 50 anos de este campus. Estos objetivos son:</p>
<p>&#8226; <strong>Cuatros anos o menos</strong>: En colaboraci&#243;n con el senado acad&#233;mico, quiero examinar y racionalizar los requisitos principales para garantizar que los estudiantes puedan tener una experiencia educativa desafiante y gratificante, y obtener un t&#237;tulo - &#160;de que ellos y nosotros podemos&#160; estar orgullosos - en cuatro a&#241;os o menos.</p>
<p>&#8226; <strong>Aumento de la retencion</strong>:&#160; Quiero mejorar la tasa actual de retenci&#243;n de los estudiantes en UCSC. Moviendo nuestra tasa global ser&#225; un proceso largo, pero podemos aspirar a corto plazo para mejorar nuestras tasas de retenci&#243;n de primer a&#241;o de un 2 por ciento, y bajar la atrici&#243;n en la divisi&#243;n superior por debajo del 10 por ciento.</p>
<p>&#8226; <strong>Aumentar la matricula de estudiantes no residentes</strong>: &#160;Un aumento modesto en el n&#250;mero de estudiantes nacionales no residentes, y estudiantes internacionales, a 5 por ciento de la matr&#237;cula total de estudiantes, de los niveles actuales de alrededor de 3.5 por ciento, ser&#237;a diversificar nuestro cuerpo de estudiantes y proporcionar el campus con recursos adicionales.</p>
<p>&#8226; <strong>Estado de Instituci&#243;n de Servicio de los Hispanos (HIS):</strong>Ya tenemos una s&#243;lida trayectoria educando los estudiantes Latinos y Latinas. Estado HSI aumentar&#237;a nuestra visibilidad como una tuber&#237;a a la Universidad - y m&#225;s all&#225; - para todos los estudiantes de los grupos menos representados.</p>
<p>&#8226; <strong>La estabilidad financier</strong>: Quiero ser capaz de preparar un presupuesto de tres a&#241;os con una expectativa razonable que ser&#225; el plazo de 5 por ciento del presupuesto real.&#160; Esto beneficiar&#225; a profesores y estudiantes por lo que nos permite trazar el plan de estudios y el plan de disponibilidad de cursos con certeza mucho mayor.</p>
<p>Mi enfoque en estos objetivos deliberadamente orientados a los estudiantes, reconoce el impacto de los recortes presupuestarios y aumentos en la matr&#237;cula ha tenido en los estudiantes. En pocas palabras, creo que estos objetivos ayudar&#225;n a garantizar que los estudiantes obtienen valor de su dinero y son capaces de avanzar con celeridad hacia la graduaci&#243;n.</p>
<p>Para terminar, quiero expresar mi gratitud a todos los colegas que han colaborado conmigo sobre los retos presupuesto de este a&#241;o. Tambi&#233;n quiero felicitar a <a href="http://events.ucsc.edu/commencement/">los miles de estudiantes de la UCSC que est&#225;n a punto de graduarse</a>, y dar las gracias a todo el personal y los profesores que han ayudado a llegar a este hito.&#160; Ir, &#8220;Banana Slugs&#8221;!</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4889d5ec80727046012375a3b5c82e65"><name>los-mejicas</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Grupo Folklórico Los Mejicas performs on June 3-4</title><summary>On June 3 and 4, students in Grupo Folklórico Los Mejicas mark the organization’s 39th anniversary with a spring dance performance on UC Santa Cruz’s Theater Arts Main Stage.</summary><keywords>Grupo Folklórico Los Mejicas, UC Santa Cruz</keywords><start-date>1306828800000</start-date><display-name>Grupo Folklórico performance</display-name><path>/2011/05/los-mejicas</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/05/los-mejicas</link><created-by>jrburns</created-by><created-on>1306887050618</created-on><last-modified-by>jrburns</last-modified-by><last-modified>1306887227155</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Prospective Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Events</value><value>Press Release</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Los Mejicas</name><title></title><phone/><email>mejicas@hotmail.com</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>This year’s theme is 'El Orgullo de mi Tierra' (The Pride of My Country)</article-subhead><article-text><p>On June 3 and 4, students in Grupo Folkl&#243;rico Los&#160;Mejicas mark the organization&#8217;s 39<span>th</span> anniversary with a spring dance performance on UC&#160;Santa Cruz&#8217;s Theater Arts Main Stage.
