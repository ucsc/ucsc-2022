Astronomers at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and their coauthors analyzed the orbital dynamics of the system, determined the sizes and masses of the planets, and figured out their likely compositions--all based on Kepler's measurements of the changing brightness of the host star (called Kepler-11) as the planets passed in front of it.</p>
<p>"Not only is this an amazing planetary system, it also validates a powerful new method to measure the masses of planets," said Daniel Fabrycky, a Hubble postdoctoral fellow at UC Santa Cruz, who led the orbital dynamics analysis. Fabrycky and Jack Lissauer, a scientist at NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, are the lead authors of a paper on Kepler-11 published in the February 3 issue of <em>Nature</em>.</p>
<p>The five inner planets in the Kepler-11 system range in size from 2.3 to 13.5 times the mass of the Earth. Their orbital periods are all less than 50 days, so they orbit within a region that would fit inside the orbit of Mercury in our solar system. The sixth planet is larger and farther out, with an orbital period of 118 days and an undetermined mass.</p>
<p>"Of the six planets, the most massive are potentially like Neptune and Uranus, but the three lowest mass planets are unlike anything we have in our solar system," said Jonathan Fortney, assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC, who led the work on understanding the structure and composition of the planets, along with UCSC graduate students Eric Lopez and Neil Miller.</p>

</div>
<p>The Kepler space telescope detects planets that "transit" or pass in front of their host star, causing periodic dips in the brightness of the star as measured by the telescope's sensitive photometer. The amount of the brightness reduction tells scientists how big the planet is in terms of its radius. The time between transits tells them its orbital period. To determine the planets' masses, Fabrycky analyzed slight variations in the orbital periods caused by gravitational interactions among the planets.</p>
<p>"The timing of the transits is not perfectly periodic, and that is the signature of the planets gravitationally interacting," he said. "By developing a model of the orbital dynamics, we worked out the masses of the planets and verified that the system can be stable on long time scales of millions of years."</p>
<p>Previously, detections of transiting planets have been followed up with observations from powerful ground-based telescopes to confirm the planet and determine its mass using Doppler spectroscopy, which measures the "wobble" in the motion of the star caused by the gravitational tug of the planet. With Kepler-11, however, the planets are too small and the star (2,000 light-years away) is too faint for Doppler spectroscopy to work. This is likely to be the case with many of the planets detected by the Kepler mission, the main goal of which is to find small, Earth-size planets in the habitable zones of their stars.</p>
<p>"We will need to use orbital dynamics a lot with the Kepler mission to measure the masses of planets, so we expect to be doing a lot of those analyses," Fabrycky said.</p>
<p>More than 100 transiting planets have been observed by Kepler and other telescopes, but the vast majority of them are Jupiter-like gas giants, and almost all of them are in single-planet systems. The Kepler-11 system is remarkable in terms of the number of planets, their small sizes, and their closely packed orbits. Before this, astronomers had determined both size and mass for only three exoplanets smaller than Neptune. Now, a single planetary system has added five more. The sixth planet in Kepler-11 is separated enough from the others that the orbital perturbation method can't be used to determine its mass, Fabrycky said.</p>

</div>
<p>As is the case in our solar system, all of the Kepler-11 planets orbit in more or less the same plane. This finding reinforces the idea that planets form in flattened disks of gas and dust spinning around a star, and the disk pattern is conserved after the planets have formed, Fabrycky said. "The coplanar orbits in our solar system inspired this theory in the first place, and now we have another good example. But that and the Sun-like star are the only parts of Kepler-11 that are like the solar system," he said.</p>
<p>The densities of the planets (derived from mass and radius) provide clues to their compositions. All six planets have densities lower than Earth's. "It looks like the inner two could be mostly water, with possibly a thin skin of hydrogen-helium gas on top, like mini-Neptunes," Fortney said. "The ones farther out have densities less than water, which seems to indicate significant hydrogen-helium atmospheres."</p>
<p>That's surprising, because a small, hot planet should have a hard time holding onto a lightweight atmosphere. "These planets are pretty hot because of their close orbits, and the hotter it is the more gravity you need to keep the atmosphere," Fortney said. "My students and I are still working on this, but our thoughts are that all these planets probably started with more massive hydrogen-helium atmospheres, and we see the remnants of those atmospheres on the ones farther out. The ones closer in have probably lost most of it."</p>
<p>One reason a six-planet system is so exciting is that it allows scientists to make these kinds of comparisons among planets within the same system. "That's really powerful, because we can work out what's happened to this system as a whole," Fortney said. "Comparative planetary science is how we've come to understand our solar system, so this is much better than just finding more solitary hot Jupiters around other stars."</p>
<p>For example, the presence of small planets with hydrogen-helium atmospheres suggests that this system formed relatively quickly, he said. Studies indicate that stellar disks lose their hydrogen and helium gas within about 5 million years. "So it tells us how quickly planets can form," Fortney said.</p>
<p>The inner planets are so close together that it seems unlikely they formed where they are now, he added. "At least some must have formed farther out and migrated inward. If a planet is embedded in a disk of gas, the drag on it leads to the planet spiralling inward over time. So formation and migration had to happen early on."</p>

company&#8217;s 2011 lineup today, noting some exciting new developments as SSC heads into its 30th anniversary season.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;To celebrate our first 30 years, I am thrilled to bring back a celebrated production from our past, to embark on a three-year cycle of history plays, and to announce the return of our annual holiday musical co-produced with the UCSC Theater Arts Department,&#8221; said Barricelli.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I am also pleased to announce a renewed partnership with Montalvo Arts Center in Saratoga, where SSC last performed in 1992,&#8221; he added.<br/>
<br/>
The season will open with an updated version of Shakespeare&#8217;s <strong>The Comedy of Errors</strong>--one of the most popular productions in SSC&#8217;s history--directed by Danny Scheie in the indoor Mainstage Theater. Former artistic director of SSC from 1993 to 1995, Scheie is currently on the faculty of the Theater Arts Department.<br/>
<br/>
Playing in the outdoor Festival Glen will be <strong>The Three Musketeer</strong>s adapted by Linda Alper, Douglas Langworthy, and Penny Metropulos, based on the novel by Alexandre Dumas, and directed by Art Manke (2008&#8217;s <em>Bach at Leipzig</em>).&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Also playing in the Glen will be Shakespeare&#8217;s <strong>Henry IV, Part On</strong>e, directed by Scott Wentworth (2009&#8217;s <em>Love&#8217;s Labor&#8217;s Lost</em>).&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Barricelli noted that this will mark the beginning of a three-year cycle of Shakespeare&#8217;s history plays known as the &#8220;Henriad,&#8221; which will continue in 2012 with <em>Henry IV, Part Two</em>, and conclude in 2013 with <em>Henry V</em>.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;The history plays feature some of the most dramatic storytelling in the canon, and I think it will be very exciting for our audience to follow this story over the next three seasons,&#8221; he said.<br/>
<br/>
The annual Fringe show--featuring SSC&#8217;s acting interns--will round out the season in the Sinsheimer-Stanley Festival Glen. This year&#8217;s production will be <strong>The Brothers Menaechmus</strong> by Plautus, directed by theater arts professor/actress Patty Gallagher (2009&#8217;s <em>The School for Fianc&#233;(e)s</em>).<br/>
<br/>
After the close of this year&#8217;s summer season, SSC&#8217;s production of <strong>The Comedy of Errors</strong> will move to Montalvo Arts Center in Saratoga, where it will have an extended run from September 9&#160; to 18 in the 1200-seat, outdoor Lilian Fontaine Garden Theatre.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Barricelli noted that SSC and Montalvo Arts Center have a history of collaboration going back two decades, when SSC transferred several productions there during the early '90s.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Renewing our relationship with Montalvo Arts Center is a hugely important development in growing our institution and broadening our reach to audiences outside of Santa Cruz County,&#8221; Barricelli observed. &#8220;This is an exciting first step in what I hope will be a long and very fruitful partnership.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#160; <strong>--Annual Holiday Musical and Benefit Performances to Return in Fall--</strong></p>
The ever popular SSC holiday show returns in 2011 after a two-year break with <strong>A Year With Frog and Toad</strong>--a family-friendly musical based on the &#8220;Frog and Toad&#8221; books by Arnold Lobel. <br/>
<br/>
The show played 88 performances on Broadway in 2003 and was nominated for three Tony Awards, including Best Musical.<br/>
<br/>
A co-production with the UCSC Theater Arts Department, <strong>A Year With Frog and Toad</strong> will run from November 18 to December 11 in the Mainstage Theater. <br/>
<br/>
The collaboration between SSC and Theater Arts on a holiday show began in 1997, under former artistic director Paul Whitworth, and continued until 2009 when budget cuts forced a two-year hiatus. <br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I&#8217;m really pleased that we can bring the holiday show back this year,&#8221; said Theater Arts chair David Lee Cuthbert. &#8220;The holiday show is a wonderful opportunity for our students to gain experience working with a professional company, and I know it&#8217;s a tradition loved by the community.&#8221; <br/>
<br/>
And longtime Oregon Shakespeare Festival actor Robin Goodrin Nordli will bring her original, one-woman show <strong>Bard Babes</strong> to the Mainstage Theater on November 19 and 20 for SSC&#8217;s second annual benefit performance for its education and internship programs.&#160; <br/>
<br/>
Also coming up: Shakespeare Santa Cruz&#8217;s 30th birthday bash on Cooper Street in downtown Santa Cruz on Saturday, April 16, from 1 to 5 p.m. The event will be free and open to the public. Stay tuned for more details!<br/>

They are both students at the Harker School in San Jose, the only school in the country to produce two finalists (out of a total of 40 nationwide).</p>
<p>Finalists Nikhil Parthasarathy and Rohan Mahajan were among four Harker semifinalists who did summer research internships at UCSC in 2010. Parthasarathy studied the structures of distant galaxies under the guidance of postdoctoral researcher Kamson Lai and Sandra Faber, University Professor and chair of astronomy and astrophysics. His project title is "A Morphological Analysis of z&#126;3 Lyman Break Galaxies in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field." Mahajan investigated the use of solar cells to generate hydrogen fuel under the guidance of Yat Li, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry. His project title is "The Effect of Doping on CdS Sensitized Ti02 Nanowires for Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen Generation."</p>
<p>A total of 15 high school students took part in UCSC's <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/07/3954.html">summer internship program</a> coordinated by Puragra Guhathakurta, professor of astronomy and astrophysics. Guhathakurta organized the summer internship program last year after mentoring three Harker students in 2009, one of whom was a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/02/3521.html">finalist</a> in the Intel competition. (The other two were semifinalists.)</p>
<p>"It was very gratifying to see the program grow so rapidly from 2009 to 2010," Guhathakurta said. "The students are amazingly bright, motivated, and hard working. They jump right into their projects and are ready to drink from the fire hose. It comes as no surprise that the students are proving to be successful on a nationwide scale in these science competitions. This is wonderful recognition of the excellent academic preparation that goes on in these high schools and the world-class scientific research that gets carried out at UCSC."</p>
The <a href="http://www.societyforscience.org/STS">Intel Science Talent Search</a> encourages talented U.S. high school seniors to pursue independent research in science, math, engineering, and medicine. Finalists will gather in Washington, D.C., for a week-long event in March. They will undergo a rigorous judging process, meet with national leaders, interact with leading scientists, and display their research at the National Geographic Society. The top winner will receive $100,000 from the Intel Foundation.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ec7a759e8072704601015f88cb8c7b53"><name>plum-tv</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC faculty featured in "Masters of Innovation" episode on Plum TV</title><summary>Two cutting-edge laboratories at UCSC are featured in a recent episode of the "Masters of Innovation" program on the Plum TV network.</summary><keywords>Chemical Screening Center, Bionics Lab, Plum TV, Roger Linington, Scott Lokey, Jacob Rosen</keywords><start-date>1296723600000</start-date><display-name>"Masters of Innovation"</display-name><path>/2011/02/plum-tv</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/02/plum-tv</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1296752604490</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1316474744317</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computer Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Chemistry and Biochemistry</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Human Health</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/02/images/plum-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/02/images/plum-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>plum-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>plum-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>27721</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Two cutting-edge laboratories at UC Santa Cruz are featured in a recent episode of the "Masters of Innovation" program on the Plum TV network. The show spotlights the search for new drugs at UCSC's Chemical Screening Center and medical robotics projects in the Bionics Lab at the Baskin School of Engineering.</p>
<p>In the "<a href="http://www.plumtv.com/videos/masters-of-innovation-biological-frontiers">Biological Frontiers</a>" episode, host Jim Brasher explores advances in biotechnology from three UC campuses in the Bay Area--UC Santa Cruz, UC Berkeley, and UC San Francisco. Two of the four segments focus on UCSC. At the Chemical Screening Center, Brasher interviewed Roger Linington, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry, and center director Scott Lokey, professor of chemistry and biochemistry. Brasher also interviewed Jacob Rosen, associate professor of computer engineering, and graduate student Levi Miller at the Bionics Lab, where Rosen leads projects on surgical robotics and a robotic exoskeleton with potential applications for stroke recovery.</p>

</object><strong>Susan Hammer</strong>, UCSC Foundation trustee and former mayor of San Jose, talks about the UCSC Scholarship Benefit Dinner</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz will host its eighth annual Scholarship Benefit Dinner on Saturday, February 26, at the Fairmont Hotel in San Jose.<br/>
<br/>
The annual benefit dinner is one of UCSC's premier fundraising events&#8212;with proceeds providing significant undergraduate scholarships and fellowships for students to help them attain their fullest academic potential.<br/>
<br/>
Many recipients are students who might not otherwise be able to attend the university without this support.<br/>
<br/>
For the second year in a row, the gala will be held in Silicon Valley, where UCSC faculty and alumni continue to contribute to the innovative research, educational programs, and cutting-edge technologies that define the Valley.<br/>
&#160;<br/>
UCSC alumna <strong>Kathryn D. Sullivan</strong> (Cowell &#8217;73)&#8212;the first American woman to walk in space&#8212;will be the keynote speaker at the event.<br/>
<br/>
Sullivan was nominated by President Obama in December to serve as the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Environmental Observation and Prediction.</p>
<p>The position oversees the National Weather Service and provides policy oversight for National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration work related to ocean and climate activities.</p>
<p>UCSC alumnus <strong>Stephen Abreu</strong> (Kresge &#8217;99, M.A. &#8217;03) will serve as emcee for the gala evening supporting student scholarships.<br/>
<br/>
Abreu is an industry contracts manager for UC San Francisco&#8217;s Diabetes Center and Immune Tolerance Network, where his job places him at the crossroads of business and science.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Born into a working class family, he came to UCSC on a $10,000 scholarship award created by chancellor emeritus Karl Pister.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;UCSC was really a formative place,&#8221; said Abreu, a passionate advocate and speaker for diversity in higher education and the workplace. &#8220;It was a place where I could find myself, where I could find my own way.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
With a theme of "Launching Bright Futures," the festivities will include a cocktail reception at 6 p.m., followed by dinner at 7 p.m. The public is invited.<br/>
<br/>
More students than ever now need financial assistance to attend the university, and in recent years, low and middle income families have been particularly hard-hit by increased costs.<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Due to the reduction in state support for the University of California, UC fees for an undergraduate California resident are approximately $11,124 for 2011-12. Nearly two-thirds of UC undergraduates received some form of financial assistance in the past academic year.</p>
<p>Last year's sold-out Scholarship Benefit Dinner raised over $190,000 for UCSC undergraduate scholarships.</p>

Jerry Brown's proposed half-billion-dollar cut to the University of California budget is so enormous, it&#8217;s hard to visualize the impact. What does a potential $500 million reduction look like, and how might it affect UC Santa Cruz? And what can the UCSC community do about it in the meantime?</p>
<p>Those were some of the hard questions that educators, faculty members, students and political leaders posed Friday during the second annual UCSC Legislative Forum, prompted by the newly elected Brown&#8217;s proposed state budget package.</p>
<p>If approved as-is by the Legislature, the 2011-12 budget would reduce public spending by $12.5 billion, including the half-billion-dollar UC cut.</p>
<p>But several speakers at the forum, which drew 70 people to the UCSC Inn in Santa Cruz, emphasized that the outcome will be much bleaker unless the governor succeeds in his push to bring a ballot measure to California&#8217;s voters this June, potentially extending a temporary increase in income, vehicle and sales taxes, a measure that Republican state legislators oppose.</p>
<p>If supporters get the measure on the ballot, they must make an all-out push to get the word out to voters in June, said State Senator Joe Simitian, D-Palo Alto, who attended the forum. &#160;&#8220;If the measure is not put on the ballot, or if it is defeated in June, you&#8217;re talking about another $500 million (cut) for the UC system,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Under such a scenario, &#8220;it is almost unthinkable to imagine what will happen,&#8221; UCSC said Chancellor George Blumenthal, who moderated the event.</p>
<p>&#160;&#8220;Nobody likes to pay taxes, but the question is, how do we as a society join together to be part of a shared solution and share the pain?&#8221; said 27<sup>th</sup> District Assemblyman Bill Monning, D-Carmel, also in attendance. He added that the absence of a ballot measure would result in UC having to &#8220;close institutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Based on how UCSC fared during past budget cutbacks, the campus&#8217;s share of the cuts could be $31 million, equal to the cost of educating 1,500 students, UCSC Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway told the crowd.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the entire budget of our Physical and Biological Sciences Division, or our School of Engineering and our Arts Division combined,&#8221; Galloway said.</p>
<p>Galloway mentioned a familiar rallying cry at protests &#8211; &#8220;cut the administration.&#8221; In response, she said potential cutbacks are so massive that UCSC would have to eliminate its entire Business and Administrative Services Division&#8212;including police, fire, environmental health and safety services, human resources, physical planning and construction, transportation and parking, grounds and custodial services&#8212;to absorb the cut.</p>
<p>All the while, she said, UCSC would still have obligations and rising mandatory costs. For instance, campus contributions to the pension system increased $4.2 million this year, and are projected to rise another $4 million, Galloway said.</p>
<p>She also mentioned ways UCSC saved money and stretched itself thin before the latest dire budget news. Last year, Galloway said,&#160; campus-wide furloughs, which reduced paychecks between four and 10 percent, saved $12.5 million &#8220;but it was one-time savings. We don&#8217;t get that money back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Such cuts have already left UCSC in a weakened state, she said, and further cuts could make the entire UC system &#8220;increasingly vulnerable&#8221; to competitors who are trying to hire faculty away.</p>
<p>Professor of ocean sciences Peggy Delaney, UCSC&#8217;s Vice Chancellor for Planning and Budget, said the campus has already eliminated funding for 80 faculty positions, along with 110 quarters of teaching assistant time.&#160; She said that UCSC has worked hard to protect core academics, but with a reduction in funding for faculty positions, the campus has been forced to cut classes.</p>
<p>At first UCSC &#8220;started on the edges&#8221; by chopping discussion sections from some general education courses and reducing the number of electives, but now cuts are impacting primary classes that students need to graduate, she said.</p>
<p>UCSC&#8217;s Student Union Assembly representative, Amanda Buchanan, talked about fees and tuition rising at the same time that students are witnessing a reduction in available classes and services.</p>
<p>&#8220;If classes are cut, we will not be able to graduate in four years,&#8221; Buchanan said.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="00f3fab68072704601015f88ad550685"><name>newcomb-cleveland</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC's Richard Green honored for top research paper in Science</title><summary>Bioinformatics expert Richard Green has won the Newcomb Cleveland Prize for his paper on the Neanderthal genome.</summary><keywords>Richard Green, Ed Green, Neanderthal genome, Newcomb Cleveland Prize, AAAS</keywords><start-date>1297069200000</start-date><display-name>Richard Green honored</display-name><path>/2011/02/newcomb-cleveland</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/02/newcomb-cleveland</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1297096112732</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1297096242787</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Biomolecular Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/02/images/Green-175.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/02/images/Green-175.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Green-175.jpg</name><display-name>Green-175.jpg</display-name><file-size>42801</file-size><width>175</width><height>245</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/02/images/Green-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/02/images/Green-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Green-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>Green-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>26600</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Richard E.

The prize is given annually to the authors of an outstanding paper published in the association's journal <em>Science</em>.</p>
<p>Green, an assistant professor of biomolecular engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz, began working on the Neanderthal genome project as a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. He led a major bioinformatics effort, writing software and developing computational techniques needed to analyze ancient DNA extracted from fossil bones. He also coordinated the overall design and logistics of the project.</p>
<p>The prize-winning paper, "A Draft Sequence of the Neandertal Genome," was published in the May 7, 2010, issue of <em>Science.</em> It prompted a worldwide flurry of media coverage, mostly focused on the discovery of Neanderthal DNA sequences in the genomes of present-day non-Africans, indicating that Neanderthals and humans interbred shortly after early modern humans migrated out of Africa. The Neanderthal genome has also enabled researchers to identify genetic features that are unique to modern humans.</p>
<p>Green is first author of the paper, which involved 56 coauthors from 22 different institutions. The coauthors include Svante P&#228;&#228;bo of the Max Planck Institute and David Reich of Harvard Medical School.</p>
<p>The team obtained the draft sequence of the Neanderthal genome by analyzing DNA extracted from 40,000-year-old bones of Neanderthals. Extraordinary efforts were required to prevent contamination of the samples with human DNA, and new techniques were developed to deal with the large amounts of bacterial DNA present in the fossil bones. In December 2010, Green and other members of the same team published a second groundbreaking paper based on ancient DNA, this time describing a previously unknown group of human relatives, called "<a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/12/denisovans.html">Denisovans</a>," who lived in Asia at the same time as humans and Neanderthals.</p>
<p>The Newcomb Cleveland Prize, supported by Affymetrix, is the oldest AAAS award, established in 1923 with funds donated by Newcomb Cleveland of New York City. Each recipient receives a bronze medal and a share of the $25,000 prize.</p>
<p>A formal presentation of the prize will take place at an awards ceremony on Saturday, February 19, at the AAAS annual meeting in Washington, D.C.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="013c29e38072704601015f8830201a30"><name>bakker</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Anthropology graduate student wins prestigious Paper Prize</title><summary>Sarah Bakker, a graduate student in anthropology, is the first UC Santa Cruz student to win the prestigious Paper Prize from the Society for the Anthropology of Europe. </summary><keywords>sarah bakker, anthropology, Society for the Anthropology of Europe, Syriac Orthodox, early christians, uc santa cruz, ucsc, melissa caldwellSSa</keywords><start-date>1297069200000</start-date><display-name>Sarah Bakker</display-name><path>/2011/02/bakker</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/02/bakker</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1297100843406</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenm</last-modified-by><last-modified>1299001356169</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Anthropology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Guy Lasnier</name><title></title><phone/><email>lasnier@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/02/images/bakker-sarah-200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/02/images/bakker-sarah-200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>bakker-sarah-200.jpg</name><display-name>bakker-sarah-200.jpg</display-name><file-size>46923</file-size><width>200</width><height>267</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/02/images/bakker-sarah-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/02/images/bakker-sarah-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>bakker-sarah-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>bakker-sarah-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18220</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Sarah Bakker, graduate student in anthropology, delivers her paper on the Syriac Orthodox Christian community in the Netherlands, refugees from the Middle East.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Sarah Bakker, a graduate student in anthropology, is the first UC Santa Cruz student to win the prestigious Paper Prize from the Society for the Anthropology of Europe.</p>
<p>The prize was presented at the American Anthropological Association's annual meeting in New Orleans. Bakker was awarded the opportunity to present a research paper and have it reviewed by scholars in her field.</p>
<p>Bakker is a Ph.D. candidate studying the Syriac Orthodox Christian community in the Netherlands, refugees from the Middle East who have fled violent conflict in their native countries.&#160; The community numbers between 10,000 to15,000. Its members have moved to the Netherlands since the 1960s from Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Iran. They speak a dialect of Aramaic.</p>
<p>They face debates on secularism and tradition. "I'm looking at how they try to craft a sense of communal identity in the Netherlands," said Bakker who returned last November from a year of field work. "It is difficult for this community to be a coherent group."</p>
<p>Bakker, whose heritage is Dutch and American, grew up in the Netherlands, Alaska, and Seattle. She enrolled at UC Santa Cruz in the fall of 2006 and previously earned her bachelor's degree in classical studies and English at Kings College, London.</p>
<p>"I've always been interested in Christianity in its more unusual forms," she said. Her senior thesis at Kings College was on the early Christian church in the late Roman Empire. &#160;"I had had an interdisciplinary interest, philosophy, theater, arts, a broad approach focused on ancient Christian history," she said.</p>
<p>She discovered anthropology after taking a class while working at the University of Washington several years ago. "I immediately felt at home, felt like I was an anthropologist all this time, " she said.</p>
<p>She selected UC Santa Cruz, where she works with Professor Melissa Caldwell, "because of the quality work of the faculty," she said.</p>
<p>"I feel shaped by Santa Cruz but not limited by it," she said. "It is so inspiring, really creative, innovative, and very nurturing to my work."</p>
<p>This quarter Bakker is teaching a class on the ethnography of Europe.</p>
<p>Caldwell said Bakker has won major grants in support of her research including the <span lang="EN-US">Social Science Research Council's International Dissertation Research Fellowship and the Wenner-Gren Foundation's Dissertation Research Fellowship for anthropological research.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/02/images/bakker-sarah-uncommon.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/02/images/bakker-sarah-uncommon.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>bakker-sarah-uncommon.jpg</name><display-name>bakker-sarah-uncommon.jpg</display-name><file-size>4818</file-size><width>216</width><height>90</height></thumb><thumb-alt>Sarah Bakker</thumb-alt><title>Sarah Bakker</title><description>Sarah Bakker, a graduate student in anthropology, is the first UC Santa Cruz student to win the prestigious Paper Prize from the Society for the Anthropology of Europe.</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0185aecc8072704601015f8872bab32e"><name>budget-reductions</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Budget challenge</title><summary>As you probably know, Gov.

<br/>
Last year, in anticipation of increasing costs and declining state revenues, we made cuts into the permanent budget rather than relying on temporarily available funds. Because of that prudent action, we now face an actual shortfall of approximately $19 million for the year that begins July 1.<br/>
<br/>
Campus leaders, including members of the Academic Senate, have been briefed on the scope of this new budget challenge and the institutional priorities that will guide our decisions. Full details of our guiding principles are available on the campus's <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/budget-update/">Budget Update</a> web site.<br/>
<br/>
Among our top priorities are the academic needs of students, teaching and research resources for faculty, and our need to seek additional revenues from non-state sources.<br/>
<br/>
It's clear that we need to envision a "new normal." After several years of significant budget cuts and a steady, long-term decline in state support, doing everything we've done on fewer resources has become unsustainable.<br/>
<br/>
Late last week, I assigned preliminary budget cuts by division. The academic divisions face 6 percent cuts, while all other units must contend with 16 percent reductions.<br/>
<br/>
I met this morning with vice chancellors, deans, and Senate leadership as well as representatives of the students and staff to begin discussing the way forward. In coming weeks, we will prepare a snapshot of what campus operations would look like in the wake of a $19 million cut. That scenario will likely be part of a systemwide presentation to UC Regents at their March meeting.<br/>
<br/>
But campus discussions will continue. Chancellor Blumenthal and I will host two town hall meetings, during which we hope to hear from you. Throughout the process, I will share budget-related information with the campus.<br/>
<br/>
Although we have accommodated previous cuts as smartly as possible, they have taken a toll. We face a monumental challenge as we seek to develop new ways of delivering services in an era of diminished resources. The same ingenuity, creativity, and imagination that distinguishes our teaching and research will be needed as we navigate these challenges.</p>

Para: La Comunidad de la Universidad<br/>
De parte de: Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway<br/>
Asunto: <em>Desaf&#237;o presupuestario</em></p>
<p>Como usted probablemente sabe, el gobernador Brown ha propuesto un corte de $500 millones al sistema de la Universidad de California para el a&#241;o fiscal 2011-12. Es probable que nuestra proporci&#243;n ser&#225; m&#225;s o menos&#160; el 6 por ciento, o alrededor de $31 millones de d&#243;lares.<br/>
<br/>
El a&#241;o pasado, en anticipaci&#243;n del aumento de los costos y la disminuci&#243;n de los ingresos del Estado, hemos hecho cortes en el presupuesto permanente en lugar de depender en los fondos disponibles temporalmente. A causa de esa acci&#243;n prudente, ahora nos enfrentamos con una insuficiencia de aproximadamente $19 millones para el a&#241;o que comienza el 1 de julio.</p>
<p>Los l&#237;deres de la Universidad, incluyendo los miembros del Senado Acad&#233;mico, han sido informados sobre el alcance de este desaf&#237;o y las prioridades institucionales que guiar&#225;n nuestras decisiones. Los detalles completos de nuestros principios est&#225;n disponibles en el sitio <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/budget-update/">Budget Update</a> (actualizaci&#243;n de presupuesto).<br/>
<br/>
Entre nuestras prioridades principales son las necesidades acad&#233;micas de los estudiantes, la ense&#241;anza y los recursos de investigaci&#243;n para el profesorado, y tambi&#233;n nuestra necesidad de buscar ingresos adicionales que provienen de fuentes no estatales.</p>
<p>Est&#225; claro que tenemos que imaginar una "nueva normalidad." Despu&#233;s de varios a&#241;os de cortes significativos presupuestarios y un descenso constante en apoyo del Estado, haciendo todo lo que hemos hecho con menos recursos - se ha vuelto insostenible.</p>
<p>La semana pasada, asigne cortes preliminares de presupuesto para cada divisi&#243;n. Las divisiones acad&#233;micas se &#160;enfrentan con cortes de 6 por ciento, mientras que todas las otras divisiones deben contender con reducciones de 16 por ciento.</p>
<p>Me reun&#237; este lunes con los vicecancilleres, decanos, y el liderazgo del Senado, tambi&#233;n con representantes de los estudiantes y el personal, para comenzar a discutir el camino que debemos seguir. En las pr&#243;ximas semanas, vamos a preparar una visi&#243;n de c&#243;mo se ver&#237;an las&#160; operaciones de la Universidad con un corte de $19 millones. Este escenario probablemente ser&#225; parte de una presentaci&#243;n a los regentes de la Universidad de California en su reuni&#243;n de marzo.</p>
<p>De cualquier manera las discusiones de nuestra Universidad continuaran. Canciller Blumenthal y yo seremos anfitriones de dos reuniones de ayuntamiento, durante cuales esperamos escuchar sus comentarios. Durante las reuniones, voy a compartir informaci&#243;n presupuestaria con la Universidad.</p>
<p>Aunque inteligentemente hemos &#160;acomodado cortes anteriores, estas han dejado su huella. Estamos enfrentando un reto monumental al tratar de desarrollar nuevas formas de prestaci&#243;n de servicios en una &#233;poca de la disminuci&#243;n de recursos. El mismo ingenio, la creatividad y la imaginaci&#243;n que distingue nuestra ense&#241;anza y la investigaci&#243;n, ser&#225; necesaria a medida que continuemos navegando estos desaf&#237;os.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UCSC Community</audience><admin>Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0238c44e8072704601015f8899064f03"><name>ucsc-in-the-news-2-7-11</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>Latin American and Latino Studies professor Jonathan Fox was quoted in a widely published article about the loss of jobs in Mexico stemming from the importation of cheap corn from the U.S. </summary><start-date>1297069200000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News</display-name><path>/2011/02/ucsc-in-the-news-2-7-11</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/02/ucsc-in-the-news-2-7-11</link><created-by>gwenm</created-by><created-on>1297117397978</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1297189300560</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>UCSC in the News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>Latin American and Latino Studies</span> professor Jonathan Fox was quoted in an article about the loss of jobs in Mexico stemming from the importation of cheap corn from the U.S. The article by the <em>McClatchy</em> newspaper chain's Mexico correspondent was published around the country, including the <strong><em>Sacramento</em></strong>, <strong><em>Fresno</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Modesto Bees,</em></strong> and papers in Minneapolis, Kansas City, Tacoma, Wash., and Flagstaff, Ariz.</p>

<ul>
<li>Establishing and maintaining communication between the different groups involved in a demonstration;</li>
<li>The responsibilities of observers from Labor Relations, Student Affairs, and faculty during a demonstration;</li>
<li>The responsibilities of people participating in the demonstration;</li>
<li>The presence and involvement of public safety officers;</li>
<li>The use of photography and video; and</li>
<li>The consequences when campus policy or other regulations are violated during a demonstration.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once established, DAG will include a cross-section of the campus community including faculty, students, and staff.&#160; Union-represented and non-represented employees will be selected in two ways:&#160; 1) the Staff Advisory Board and University Labor United recommended one staff representative each; and 2) two staff members, one union&#8209;represented and one non-represented, will be selected from the general campus population through an <span><a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/M5X5L37">application form</a></span>.&#160; Staff who wish to apply must submit a statement of interest by midnight February 10, using the on-line <span><a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/M5X5L37">form</a>.</span>&#160; Applicants are asked to provide general information and answer the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why do you want to serve on this committee?</li>
<li>What experience or perspective would you bring to this committee?</li>
</ul>

<p>The Chancellor and I anticipate that the group will meet as often as needed during this academic year in order to provide us with a set of recommendations by the end of June 2011.&#160; I look forward to reviewing the applications from those of you interested in serving on this vital committee.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>All represented and non-represented staff</audience><admin>Alison Galloway Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="0ca0bc648072704601015f88dac728ca"><name>uncommon-laura-amico</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumna aims to chronicle every D.C. homicide victim</title><summary>Laura Norton Amico (Merrill '04, anthropology), a former police reporter, has quietly carved out a role for herself as D.C.'s most comprehensive chronicler of the unlawful taking of human life.</summary><start-date>1297242000000</start-date><display-name>Alumna chronicles D.C. homicides</display-name><path>/2011/02/uncommon-laura-amico</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/02/uncommon-laura-amico</link><created-by>gwenm</created-by><created-on>1297291983863</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1297296725911</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/02/images/amico-laura.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/02/images/amico-laura.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>amico-laura.jpg</name><display-name>amico-laura.jpg</display-name><file-size>17716</file-size><width>350</width><height>243</height></image><image-alt>Laura Norton Amico</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/02/images/amico-laura-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/02/images/amico-laura-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>amico-laura-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>amico-laura-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>3044</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Laura Norton Amico</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Laura Norton Amico walks through an alley in Columbia Heights where a 17-year-old girl was found dead in a garbage container. <span class="credit">(<em>Washington Post</em>)</span></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>On the morning of Nov. 15, Laura Norton Amico (Merrill '04, anthropology) found herself penned inside a scrum of journalists who had packed a room at D.C.

<p>Amico, 29, a former police reporter from Santa Rosa, has quietly carved out a role for herself as the District's most comprehensive chronicler of the unlawful taking of human life. Since October, she has documented her efforts on a blog called <a href="http://homicidewatch.org/">Homicide Watch D.C.</a> Her mission sounds simple: "Mark every death. Remember every victim.

White believes in living feminism not just talking about it.</p>
<p>In her new book, <em>African Americans Doing Feminism: Putting Theory into Everyday Practice</em> (SUNY Press, 2010), the associate professor of psychology at UC Santa Cruz collects the personal reflections of 18 individuals who are living feminism or practicing it in their everyday lives.</p>
<p>The writers range from an 87-year-old lesbian living in an all-lesbian RV park in Arizona to a health department executive in St. Louis to White herself.</p>
<p>The book began about seven years ago when White, who describes herself as "a feminist psychologist who studies identity,"&#160; asked for submissions of essays recounting a feminist issue and how one dealt with it. She posted her query on women's studies and women's group list-serves.</p>
<p>"I wanted a mix &#8211; definitely not just academics &#8211; men and women, and different generations," White said. She heard from activists, writers, scholars, and just plain folks.</p>
<p>The result is a collection of intimate stories by people applying feminist principles to everyday situations. "People taking huge risks, telling very, very personal stories," stories of incest, rape, violence, White says, including some of her own.</p>
<p>"Part of being a feminist is breaking the silence," she said, "not being ashamed of things that were not your fault."&#160; Only two writers use pseudonyms, a nun who writes about rape by priests and a participant in 12-step programs.</p>
<p>White has a very clear definition of feminism:&#160; "An ideology that addresses the imbalance of power between men and women. If you believe that that imbalance exists and should be corrected and act on that, you are a feminist."</p>
<p>The key is to act on it, she says, "otherwise you are just an armchair intellectual."</p>
<p>White believes feminist studies too often drifts into theory unconnected with everyday practice. Also feminism is frequently seen as a white issue. Black feminism is either ignored in academia or not understood.</p>
<p>White said she selected stories from African Americans that are grounded in day-to-day experiences, based on theory, real life examples of feminism in action on such issues as personal finance, parenting, sexual harassment, romance, parenting, reproductive freedom, depression, and addiction.</p>
<p>As editor she supplemented the material with citations and additions. "I learned a lot," White says now. "I met all these new people. It was truly a labor of love, life changing."</p>
<p>This is White's second collection of personal stories. Her earlier book, <em>Ain't I a Feminist? African American Men Speak Out on Fatherhood, Friendship, Forgiveness, and Freedom</em> (SUNY Press, 2008), focused on the feminist experiences of black men.</p>
<p>Currently, she is working on two other books based on a year teaching and conducting research in Ethiopia on a Fulbright Fellowship. She taught a masters level course on feminist theory at Addis Abba University for a newly founded gender studies program that will result in one book describing how Ethiopian women apply feminist theory in their everyday lives.&#160;</p>
<p>The second book will be based on her interviews with female combat veterans ages 20 to 55 who fought in Ethiopia's 17-year civil war. She is interested in the female perspective on violence, how it differs among generations, and how the former warriors transition back to civil society in Ethiopia and in other African countries.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="15d9cceb8072704601015f883aa2321e"><name>galloway-survey</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>CLASS survey</title><summary>The Class and Lecture Availability Student Survey (CLASS) is available online through February 20.</summary><keywords>undergraduate, survey, galloway, curriculum</keywords><start-date>1297414800000</start-date><display-name>undergraduate survey</display-name><path>/2011/02/galloway-survey</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/02/galloway-survey</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1297446718551</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1297447375342</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Last spring, our undergraduate students took the initiative to survey their peers about class availability and the effects of the budget crisis on the quality of undergraduate education.&#160;The information they compiled was compared with the administration's own analysis of undergraduate curriculum capacity as we worked with deans to provide temporary bridge funding for 2010-11.</p>
<p>Our students have now worked with student leaders at other UC campuses to launch an expanded online survey for all UC undergraduates.&#160;The new questionnaire also asks students whether issues with class availability could impact their progress toward graduation and, if so, by how many quarters and why.</p>

<br/>
Kinan Valdez, who currently teaches drama at UCSC, is directing an all-student cast in the Theater Arts Department's production of his father&#8217;s play, <em>Mummified Deer</em>, running Feb. 25-27 and March 3-6 in&#160; the Mainstage Theater.<br/>
<br/>
Luis Valdez is best known as writer and director of the 1987 hit film <em>La Bamba</em>, the story of 1950s Mexican-American rock-and-roller Ritchie Valens.<br/>
<br/>
He is also the author of the award-winning play <em>Zoot Suit</em>, which ran for nearly a year at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles in the late 1970s, and was later adapted into a feature film which Valdez directed.</p>
<p>The founding artistic director of the renowned El Teatro Campesino company in San Juan Bautista, Valdez is often referred to as the father of Chicano theater. With <em>Zoot Suit</em>, he became the first Chicano director to have a play presented on Broadway in 1979.<br/>
<br/>
Luis (the author) and Kinan (the director) will make a special appearance after the UCSC student performance of <em>Mummified Deer</em> on Saturday, February 26, and again the following week on Friday, March 4, to speak about the origins of the play and take questions from the audience.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Mummified Deer</em> is a highly personal exploration of a family that moves back and forth in time--from the dawn of the Chicano Movement in 1969, to the 1920s and 30s, to the Mexican Revolution and the genocidal war against the Yaquis in Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
"On the surface, <em>Mummified Deer</em> is a family drama about the immediate life-and-death choices one family must make for their ailing and secretive matriarch,&#8221; notes director Kinan Valdez.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;But at the core, the true family drama is rooted in the catastrophic upheavals of the 20th-century 'American' borderlands."</p>
<p>"For the survivors and descendants of this collective trauma, the act of being and becoming family is a process not taken for granted,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather, it&#8217;s a perpetual quest to unearth buried roots by sifting through the wild stories of a stubborn, larger-than-life woman of mythic proportions--a survivor of the genocide and diaspora of the Yaqui Nation in Northern Mexico."<br/>
<br/>
Kinan Valdez is currently the producing artistic director of El Teatro Campesino and made his directorial debut at ETC in 1994. Since then he has directed numerous stage productions.<br/>
<br/>
His film credits include <em>King Lear; I, Priista</em>; the award-winning video short <em>Little Louise</em>; and <em>Ballad of a Soldier</em>, an independent feature film adaptation of Luis Valdez's' one-act drama <em>Soldado Razo</em>.<br/>

The UCSC community outdid itself this year when helping with a countywide food drive. Among those who helped out at a "Fill the Truck" event on campus: John Steele, programmer/analyst for campus Transportatation and Parking Services,&#160; who also serves on the campus Second Harvest holiday food drive committee; student Jill Eversole of the sorority Gamma Phi Beta; Kim Le, Director of the Student Volunteer Center; Manny Grijalva, Mail Services Manager, who also serves on the campus Second Harvest holiday food drive committee; Sophia Reller, president of Gamma Phi Beta; Chancellor George Blumenthal; and Catherine Faris, Associate Vice Chancellor for University Relations. (Photo: Carolyn Lagattuta)<br/></image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s socially conscious Slugs collected a whopping 50,541 pounds of food this year for the Second Harvest Food Bank of Santa Cruz County holiday food drive, a 53 percent increase over last year&#8217;s 33,000 pounds.</p>
<p>The haul was so big that the UCSC community has been awarded "Blue Diamond" status for its contributions &#8211; the first such time the campus has ever received this honor for a food drive. UCSC also helped Second Harvest exceed its overall goals; volunteers strived to raise 2.1 million pounds of food and cash equivalent since the holiday season and they ended up raising more than 2.2 million pounds.</p>
<p>In addition, UCSC was ranked high on a list of donors who gave canned food to the agency.</p>
<p>"Bravo," said UCSC&#8217;s mail services manager Manuel Grijalva in a congratulatory message to volunteers, including students, staff, faculty and neighboring community residents who donated, advocated and collected for the food drive.</p>
<p>Grijalva gave a special acknowledgement to the School of Engineering, whose faculty, staff and students collected $3,526 &#8211; the equivalent of 10,578 pounds of food &#8211; for the drive. "Slug engineers and scientists rock," Grijalva said.</p>
<p>Nearly 30 years old,&#160; Second Harvest Food Bank Santa Cruz County was the first food bank in the state, and is one of the nation&#8217;s oldest. The food bank, by partnering with 200 agencies and programs, helps distribute 7.2 million pounds of food every year to working poor families, children, and seniors.</p>
<p>Looking at the dramatic difference between last year&#8217;s final tally and this year&#8217;s, Grijalva attributed the increase to "consorted efforts to mobilize our creativity and energy."</p>
<p>These innovations included an uptick in student involvement, the use of on-line donations, a new attention-grabbing food drive banner, and a fanciful silent auction organized by UCSC Community Engagement Coordinator Liz Evanovich for her colleagues in University Relations. Staff vied for items including a 28-year-old bottle of cabernet sauvignon, handmade stationery and jewelry, photography, and folk-art soft sculptures.</p>
<p>On December 3, a "Fill The Truck" event was held from 8 a.m. until noon, and drew an outpouring of response. Students dropped off bags of food they collected from neighborhoods near the foot of campus. Campus Mail Services trucks made the rounds at the 2,100-acre campus, but instead of delivering parcels, they collected big sacks of canned meat, canned fish, fruits and vegetables, peanut butter, and other items.</p>
<p>Plenty of students showed up with bags of food around 11:30 a.m. that day. One group dropped off a whopping 25 bags of food. Every dollar donated to Second Harvest Food Bank allows them to distribute $8 worth of food to families in need.<br/>

In the admissions process, spring is an important time of year for prospective frosh and transfer students as they make decisions about where to enroll. Students continue to show a strong interest in the campus, our excellent faculty, and undergraduate research opportunities as well as the unique college system. More than 36,000 applications were received for fall 2011.<br/>
<br/>
 To support admitted students in their university decision-making process, the Admissions Office is again inviting admitted students and their families to learn more about the campus during the annual UCSC Spring Spotlight from April 14-23, including specific sessions for transfer students on April 22. Additionally, students can <a href="http://admissions.ucsc.edu/visit/campus-tours.html">schedule a campus tour</a> through the online registration system; admitted students can reserve a spot during Spring Spotlight and other prospective students can reserve a regular tour.<br/>
<br/>
 We continue to expand yield efforts with on-campus and online activities. This year, admissions is hosting a virtual Spring Spotlight experience on April 28 through a Web-based college fair at CollegeWeekLive. Newly admitted students in California and beyond will have the opportunity to learn more about our academic, campus, and student life programs through online text and video chats. Admissions is also continuing to partner with <a href="http://engagingeducation.org/joomla/index.php/outreach.html">student-initiated outreach efforts</a>; student organizations play an important role in outreaching and welcoming admitted students to the campus.<br/>
<br/>
 Our many visitors this spring will be curious about university life and academic opportunities and may ask you questions as they tour the campus. Please be friendly and patient&#8212;your helpfulness will affirm the positive qualities and character of the UCSC community. Also, if you notice individuals or groups that seem lost, please help them find their way. If you have other questions or see areas around campus that need attention, please contact Beatrice Atkinson-Myers in admissions (<a class="moz-txt-link-abbreviated" href="mailto:hfrogg@ucsc.edu">hfrogg@ucsc.edu</a> or 459-2352) and she will work with the appropriate unit(s) to help create the best possible experience for visitors. Finally, all campus Web sites will see increased traffic in the coming months; please take a moment to consider the online presence of your department or unit and find ways to ensure an interesting, accurate, and current presentation of our campus and programs.<br/>

Weitzman's talk, "More Than Just A Furry Face," is part of the Science Sunday lecture series at the Seymour Center at Long Marine Laboratory. The event is free with paid admission or membership.</p>
<p>Sea otters have a unique life history that makes them an important part of the near-shore environment. Weitzman will discuss how current research is being used to further our understanding of sea otters, their environment, and the conservation of one of our shoreline's most charismatic marine mammals.</p>
<p>Weitzman has been working with sea otter researchers from the U.S. Geological Survey, California Department of Fish and Game, Monterey Bay Aquarium, and UC Santa Cruz since 2007, primarily as field biologist assisting with sea otter observations, population counts, mortality studies, and dive-based captures. He is currently pursuing a graduate degree at UCSC and works as a graduate student researcher with the U.S. Geological Survey on projects in Big Sur, Monterey, and Alaska. His thesis work examines the effects of sea otter recolonization on soft-bottomed communities in Glacier Bay, Alaska.</p>
<p>Located in Santa Cruz on the bluffs overlooking Monterey Bay, the Seymour Center provides exciting and engaging ocean education programs for the visiting public and for students of all ages. It is dedicated to educating youth, families, and the general public about the role science plays in the understanding and conservation of the world's oceans. The Seymour Center is open six days a week, year-round, and serves more than 60,000 people each year.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2a585b938072704601015f8889c36a06"><name>whose-city</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Conference explores right-to-the-city movements</title><summary>A daylong conference at UC Santa Cruz on Saturday, February 26 will explore the growing urban organizing movement.

<br/>
Increasingly, city dwellers themselves have begun organizing coalitions of neighbors, workers, and environmentalists to stake a claim toward the democratic control over issues of development and resources.<br/>
<br/>
A daylong conference at UC Santa Cruz on Saturday, February 26 will explore the growing urban organizing movement. "<a href="http://urban.ihr.ucsc.edu/events/whose-city/">Whose City: Labor and the Right-to-the-City Movements</a>" will feature leading thinkers and activists in the burgeoning city movement on three panel discussions on issues of housing, wages, and economic justice; environmental justice and green jobs; and race, class, and citizenship.<br/>
<br/>
The conference is presented by the <a href="http://ihr.ucsc.edu/archives/center-for-labor-studies">Center for Labor Studies</a> and the <a href="http://urban.ihr.ucsc.edu/">Urban Studies Research Cluster</a> at UC Santa Cruz and begins at 9:30 a.m. at the Humanities Lecture Hall at UCSC. It is free and open to the public.<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Keynote speaker is <a href="http://www.gc.cuny.edu/faculty/new_faculty/harvey.htm">David Harvey</a>, the Distinguished Professor of Anthropology at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. Trained as a geographer in his native England, Harvey is a widely regarded social theorist and the leading proponent of the right-to-the-city movement.</p>
<p>His influential books include <em>The New Imperialism; Paris, Capital of Modernity</em>; <em>Social Justice and the City</em>; <em>Limits to Capital</em>; <em>The Urbanization of Capital</em>; <em>The Condition of Postmodernity</em>; <em>Justice, Nature, and the Geography of Difference</em>; <em>Spaces of Hope</em>; and <em>Spaces of Capital: Towards a Critical Geography</em>.</p>
<p>Another participant is Kevin Danaher, a UCSC alumnus, and co-founder of Global Exchange.<br/>
<br/>
Co-organizer Steve McKay, associate professor of sociology and director of the Center for Labor Studies, said the conference will bring together representatives of groups that until now haven't talked with one another much -- such groups as organized labor and neighborhood organizers that are beginning to forge coalitions.<br/>
<br/>
"We found this great intersection" of labor studies and urban studies, McKay said.<br/>
<br/>
"It's a burgeoning field," said Miriam Greenberg, associate professor of sociology, and the other conference organizer. Greenberg is also director of the Urban Studies Research Cluster, a group of faculty and graduate students from a variety of disciplines whose research focuses on cities.<br/>
<br/>
"Whose City" is co-sponsored by the Departments of Sociology, American Studies, and Latin American and Latino Studies; College 8; and the Center for Global, International, and Regional Studies at UC Santa Cruz.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://urban.ihr.ucsc.edu/events/whose-city/</url><title>Conference participants and schedule</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://davidharvey.org/</url><title>David Harvey's website</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://urban.ihr.ucsc.edu/</url><title>Urban Studies Research Cluster</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://ihr.ucsc.edu/archives/center-for-labor-studies</url><title>Center for Labor Studies</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2a8248fa8072704601015f88ff4c8139"><name>sports-roundup-feb-1-12-2011</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Sports roundup: Men's hoops, rugby, lacrosse</title><summary>In early February competition, Slug men's basketball, rugby, and lacrosse came up with mixed results--but one Slug athlete hit a milestone. </summary><start-date>1297760400000</start-date><display-name>Sports roundup Feb. 1-12, 2011</display-name><path>/2011/02/sports-roundup-feb-1-12-2011</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/02/sports-roundup-feb-1-12-2011</link><created-by>gwenm</created-by><created-on>1297793304698</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenm</last-modified-by><last-modified>1297794320347</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Sports</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Cori Houston</name><title></title><phone/><email>chouston@ucsc.edu</email></contact><contact><name>Ken Reeves, parent</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/02/images/matsuoka-ryan-game-ball.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/02/images/matsuoka-ryan-game-ball.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>matsuoka-ryan-game-ball.jpg</name><display-name>matsuoka-ryan-game-ball.jpg</display-name><file-size>24749</file-size><width>300</width><height>245</height></image><image-alt>Ryan Matsuoka receiving a game ball</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/02/images/lacrosse-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/02/images/lacrosse-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lacrosse-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>lacrosse-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>3236</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Men's lacrosse Feb. 5, 2011</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Senior Ryan Matsuoka receives a game ball to commemorate his milestone of surpassing 1,500 points as a Slug.

On Feb. 3, the UCSC men's basketball team defeated Simpson University in the West Field House with an impressive 82-54 victory. <br/>
<br/>
It was an historic night as senior Ryan Matsuoka ran his career-scoring total as a Slug to more than 1,500 points, making him the second-highest-scoring Slug in UCSC men's basketball history. Matsuoka was presented with a game ball to commemorate this outstanding achievement.<br/>
<br/>
After Jake Moore controlled the tip, the Slugs pounded the ball inside with instant dividends.<br/>
<br/>
With a big lead early, Coach Gordon Johnson was able to get plenty of playing time for all the Slugs, with freshmen Spencer Wells and Nick Hipwell adding to the scoring total.&#160; While the fast-paced Slugs committed 9 turnovers in the first half, they were just too fast for Simpson and held a 44-28 lead at intermission.<br/>
<br/>
Freshmen Nick Hipwell (10) and Trent Reeves (11) had career best-scoring nights. Tyler Hunt, going 3 for 5 behind the arc, had a seasonal best of 16 points. The team shot above 50 percent from the field for the first time this season while scoring a season-high 82 points.<br/>
<br/>
The following week, the team lost to Holy Names University in a close game--76-79--to bring their overall record to 10-13, and 5-9 against NCAA Division III institutions. <br/>
<br/>
The Slugs will host the Independents Post Season Tournament on Friday and Saturday, Feb. 25-26. Check <a href="http://goslugs.com/">goslugs.com</a> for details.<br/>

This is the time to speak up and let our voices be heard. Every quarter we fight each other to crash courses we need for graduation and every quarter we need to comprise our educational goals with classes that we do not need in order to maintain a full course load for financial aid.<br/>
<br/>
If you share this frustration, let it be heard. We, as students, need to demonstrate that we need the state to prioritize our education. We need 20% of the student population to take the UC Class and Lecture Availability Student Survey to make a difference in our University.

His family provided the campus with the following tribute:</p>
<hr/>
<p><img align="right" alt="Chris Lockwood" src="images/lockwood-chris.jpg" width="250"/>Christopher Lockwood &#8212; a loving father, husband, son, brother, friend, and sailing and biking partner &#8212; died of a heart attack on Friday, February 4, 2011, in Santa Cruz. When he passed away, he was doing one of the things he loved: after making sure his children were at school, he rode his bike up the UCSC bike path. He was 49 years old.</p>
<p>Chris was a senior engineer at the University of California Observatories in Santa Cruz, where he made significant contributions to the advancement of science by designing unique tools for astronomers on the world&#8217;s largest telescopes. His designs are in use or development in some of the forefront instruments in the world, including two state-of-the-art adaptive optics systems at the Keck Observatory and Lick Observatory. Before coming to UCSC, he worked at NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, and developed laboratory measurement capability for wind tunnel tests.</p>
<p>Chris was born in 1962 in San Luis Obispo, CA. He was raised in China Lake and Morro Bay, where he gained a passion for the desert and the ocean and all of their wildlife, particularly snakes and birds of prey. Growing up, he loved getting out on his own on a dirt bike &#8212; and being captain of his own 8-foot sailing ship. He graduated in 1988 from California Polytechnic State University with a B.S. in mechanical engineering. He moved to Santa Cruz in 1999.</p>
<p>Chris was always at home on the water. At Cal Poly he was on the sailing team and he raced competitively throughout his life, including at Monterey Bay, San Francisco Bay, and his favorite, Huntington Lake in the Sierras, where he returned every year like a migrating bird for a week of camping and sailing. The weekend before his death, he raced in the annual "Three Bridge Fiasco" on San Francisco Bay, which he and his partner won for the Moore Division in 2002.</p>
<p>Chris was an Ultimate Frisbee player and all-round athlete. He was also an avid dirt biker. He loved traveling through open landscapes and observing the minute detail of a kestrel on a cactus or the shadow of a trout on a riverbed. In central Baja, Chris and his motorcycle buddies would whoop with delight as they glided along the high country ridges, swapping the lead and trading perfect arcing slides all the way to the fish camps at the coast, where lobster tacos and a few gallons of gas awaited. Sailing, surfing and bikes were all just a platform that allowed Chris to inhale the sights, smells and thoughts that come with the outdoors. He was always armed with a trusty octagonal coffee percolator, a frisbee and a warm, insightful smile.</p>
<p>With the birth of his children, Chris focused on being an outstanding father and husband, and he had a magnetic relationship with his children. He explored everything with them &#8212; whatever sparked their interest, from king snakes and motorcycle engines to books and bath time. His inquisitive spirit was contagious &#8212; his children ask all kinds of questions, for which he had endless patience. He was preparing to race with his son Logan this summer at Huntington Lake, in the boat that his parents had used to win every pickle dish west of the Rockies. He had just taught his daughter Chloe to ride a bike. He will be missed dearly by his loved ones and friends, and will remain in the hearts of all who knew him.</p>
<p>Chris is survived by his wife, Laurie Gabriel of Santa Cruz; his son, Logan Lockwood (age 7) and daughter Chloe Lockwood (age 4); his parents, Don and Kit Lockwood of Morro Bay; and his brother, Dan Lockwood, sister-in-law Kathleen, nephew Jaren, and niece Lane, of Park City, Utah.</p>
<p>A memorial celebration of Chris&#8217;s life for the UC Community will be held on Monday, February 28, 2011 at 2:00 PM in the UCSC Arboretum Conference Room.&#160; Directions: <a href="http://arboretum.ucsc.edu/visit/directions/">http://arboretum.ucsc.edu/visit/directions/</a>&#160;</p>
<p>All are invited, and we hope you will attend.&#160; Parking is limited, so please car pool if you can.&#160;</p>
<p>A memorial fund has been created for his young children. Please send contributions by check to: Chris Lockwood Memorial Fund, Santa Cruz County Bank, 720 Front St., Santa Cruz, CA 95060.&#160;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2adcb3d08072704601015f8875068e75"><name>tango-troupe-ucsc</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Passion on the dance floor: Hard science, math students cut loose and win prizes in tango troupe</title><summary>Tango, the lusty dance from Argentina, is luring curious UCSC students, including a sturdy contingent of hard science and math students.

<br/>
<p>On a rainy night in downtown Santa Cruz, a dozen UCSC students, most of them math and hard-sciences majors, gathered in a church meeting room.</p>
<p>No one wore nerdy bifocals or carried slide rulers in their pockets. No one talked about proofs, conjunctions, flash points, or continuously differentiable functions.</p>
<p>They were too busy staring into each other's eyes with expressions of longing as they performed tango, the sultry dance that began in the working class districts of Argentina more than a century ago.</p>
<p>Olena Tashkevych, 19, moved with grace across the dance floor. She executed a perfect "gancho"&#8212;hooking a leg across the inside of her partner's knee.</p>
<p>"I'm here to relax," said the Ukrainian-born math major, who is pursuing a minor in computer science. Tashkevych looked fresh-faced considering she'd spent the day plowing through three back-to-back final exams at UCSC.</p>
<p>Tashkevych is a member of Tangroupe, a one-of-a-kind student-run campus club dedicated to the study and performance of tango.</p>
<p>Some view Tangroupe as a hard-sciences networking opportunity for UCSC students. Even its co-founders were science-oriented Slugs. Brett Griswold and Jennifer Small established Tangroupe (pronounced "tan-GROU-pay") in the fall of 2007 while Griswold was a UCSC undergraduate majoring in biology and health sciences, and Small was pursuing a Ph.D. in Earth and planetary sciences.</p>
<p>But this student group is serious about dancing. Since its foundation, Tangroupe has grown its membership from four to 60 people, and formed a competition team of 25 dancers; in fact, UCSC is the only campus in the University of California system that hosts a competition tango dance team.</p>
<p>The group has proven its devotion by picking up competition prizes while going up against dance groups from Stanford, UC Berkeley, and other universities. In 2008 and 2009, the team won first place in Formation Dance at the Berkeley Ballroom Classic. Also in 2009, the team placed third in Formation Dance at the Stanford Ballroom Classic. The group competes once again at the Berkeley Ballroom Classic on Saturday, Feb. 26.</p>
<p>On top of this, the group has been reaching out to the wider Santa Cruz tango-dancing community to hone its skills. Every week, assorted members of Tangroupe join a large group of non-Slugs at informal "practica" sessions held at the Calvary Episcopal Church in Santa Cruz under the guidance of longtime tango dancers John and Nancy Lingemann.</p>
<p><strong>The thinker's dance</strong></p>
<p>Tango's unique physicality makes it a release for these young scholars, while its painstakingly learned steps and sequences, along with its blend of improvisation and sensuality, make it an alluring challenge. After all, tango pairs rigidity and flexibility, tradition and wild improvisation, imagination and motion.</p>
<p>This makes it a natural fit for science and math students who are "used to solving problems and figuring out how things work," Taskevych said. "Tango takes a lot more thinking than people may realize."</p>
<p>Tashkevych enjoys other forms of dance, but none match tango's intellectual and soulful payoff.</p>
<p>"In ballroom and other dances, you learn sequences of moves," she said, "and all you do is those moves. With tango you can change it as you go. I very rarely dance the same dance with anyone."</p>
<p>Another Tangroupe member, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2009/04/2873.html">Scott Rohlf</a>, 23, was an Earth sciences major. Now he's pursuing a masters degree combining paleo-climatology and paleontology. In free moments, he dances tango with his pals.</p>
<p>"Tangroupe is a release for me," Rohlf said. "But I also see overlaps between my studies and Tangroupe. In geology you have to be creative because you can't always know what is going on with continents and rocks and what is going on beneath the Earth's surface. In tango and science you sometimes have to improvise."</p>
<p><strong>Enduring mystery</strong></p>
<p>According to tradition, tango's famous elliptical rotations began in the docks of Buenos Aires, along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean, where European workers mimicked the dancing styles of African slaves, melding their traditional movements with European waltz stylings.</p>
<p>The dance writer Arlene Croce describes tango as sultry without being crass; she hailed its graceful expressiveness and unique "leg language." Tango's "cruel, insinuating" eroticism has been misrepresented over time, she wrote in an essay about Tango Argentino; actually, tango can be "provocative and discreet, hot and cool, riotous and austere."</p>
<p>Some of tango's famous trademarks are the assertive leader, the intuitive follower, and the unspoken communication between partners. The dance demands an uncanny combination of focus and flow. Its "leg language" includes the rulo, in which the dancers sweep their legs across the ground, and the gancho, in which a dancer lifts legs up at a sharp angle, snaring the partner.</p>
<p>Elements are predetermined but the combinations are endless. That's one reason tango is so habit-forming. Four of the Tangroupe members are so caught up in the dance that they live together in the same house.</p>
<p>Part of this devoted quartet is Maura O'Leary, 19, formerly a math major, now studying linguistics and music. She draws on her science background when she describes tango as "transference of energies."</p>

<p>It&#8217;s another thing to reach into your own pocket, raise a pool of money and help UC Santa Cruz solve the problem. An enterprising group of UCSC students is doing just that with the newly instituted Carbon Fund, founded last spring to diminish the campus&#8217;s carbon footprint with environmentally friendly projects undertaken by staff, faculty and students.</p>
<p>So far the group has set aside an impressive $100,000 for this purpose.</p>
<p>The Carbon Fund uses money raised by Measure 44, a student-approved ballot initiative that raises money through a $3-per-quarter student fee. The fee itself is not new; it has been in place since 2006, when students imposed a previous renewable energy ballot measure. Measure 44 simply redirects that money to the carbon fund.</p>
<p>&#8220;The great part is that everyone can spare three dollars a quarter so it doesn&#8217;t seem that big of a deal and it really has a huge impact,&#8221; said Carbon Fund outreach coordinator Lindsey Roark, 21, a third-year student majoring in ecology and evolutionary biology.</p>
<p>The fund is yet another example of students taking it upon themselves to fund green initiatives. Another example is the recently completed "green" retrofitting of the Cowell Student Health Center, which was paid for with student fees and earned the campus its first &#8220;Gold&#8221; LEED certification this year.</p>
<p>Cameron Fields, 20, Campus Climate Action Intern, leads the group of students who oversee the Carbon Fund, which is set to continue for at least the next decade. Fields, an environmental studies/economics double major with a minor in politics, called the fund and the grant criteria "completely transparent."&#160; The money will be awarded based on a point system, and the guidelines are online. &#160;</p>
<p>By its very nature, the application process guarantees that successful applicants will be thoughtful and thorough. Applicants must estimate the energy or resource reduction that their projects will achieve in therms, gallons of water, gallons of fuel, or pounds of waste, while estimating the amount currently used.</p>
<p>"For example," the application reads, "if your project will reduce 100 car trips to campus per year, you&#8217;ll need to compute how many gallons of gasoline would have been used in those 100 trips. If your project will reduce electricity use from outdoor lighting, you&#8217;ll need to compute how many kWh would be consumed with and without your project."</p>
<p>It also addresses practical concerns: will the project need on-going funding after the completion of this grant? &#160;Hopefuls must also discuss their projects&#8217; potential social benefits.</p>
<p>Aware of the challenges, the fund's administrators will hold grant workshops from noon to 1 p.m. and at 5 to 6 p.m. on Thursday, February 17, at the Cervantes/Vasquez room located above the Baytree Bookstore on campus.&#160; These meetings are designed to help applicants, but they are not mandatory.</p>
<p>While the application process is thorough, the funding committee is looking for passion and commitment and not absolute perfection, Roark said.</p>
<p>"We want to get a lot of project ideas," she said. "They can be works in progress. This is all about developing student, staff and faculty collaboration. We would like to fund several different projects &#8211; and we&#8217;re hoping people will take their amazing ideas and bring them to life on the campus."</p>
<p>The committee, composed of five student members of campus sustainability groups, three staff members and an ex oficio faculty member, is still working out the specifics but Roark said that an "appropriate amount of grant money" would be somewhere between $5,000 and $10,000 per project.</p>
<p>Several staff and faculty representatives, including energy manager Patrick Testoni, purchasing specialist Kathryn Cunningham, environmental studies professor Daniel Press and environmental studies lecturer James Barsimantov are volunteering their time and expertise as advisors to the Carbon Fund.</p>
<p>The committee has yet to receive an application but expects a pile of them when the February 28 deadline rolls around. Already, Roark has heard a few ideas being discussed. One is a plan to retrofit water fountains on part of campus to make it easier for people to refill their reusable water bottles, cutting down on the consumption of single-use water bottles.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be more like a spigot so you don&#8217;t have to bend your water bottle down and shove it underneath there,&#8221; she said. &#8220;A project like that could be launched with $5,000 to $10,000.&#8221;</p>

Sloan Foundation has awarded a Sloan Research Fellowship to Richard E. (Ed) Green, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The prestigious two-year fellowship includes a $50,000 grant to support Green's research, which focuses on genome analysis and the study of ancient DNA. The Sloan Research Fellowships are given to early-career scientists and scholars in recognition of achievement and the potential to contribute substantially to their fields.</p>
<p>Green has helped pioneer the use of advanced sequencing technology to study ancient DNA extracted from fossil bones. As a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, he coordinated the Neanderthal Genome Project. A paper on the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/05/3754.html">Neanderthal genome</a> published in 2010 earned him the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/02/newcomb-cleveland.html">Newcomb Cleveland Prize</a> for the outstanding paper published in the journal <em>Science</em>. A subsequent paper published in December described a previously unknown group of human relatives, called "<a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/12/denisovans.html">Denisovans</a>." In addition to the Neanderthal genome and ancient DNA, Green's research interests include human evolutionary genetics and the regulation of gene expression.</p>
<p>Green earned a B.S. in genetics at the University of Georgia, Athens, and a Ph.D. in molecular and cell biology, with an emphasis in computational and genomic biology, at UC Berkeley. He joined the faculty of the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz in January 2010.</p>
<p>The Sloan Research Fellowships are awarded in close cooperation with the scientific community. Potential fellows must be nominated for recognition by their peers and are selected by an independent panel of senior scholars. The fellowships are awarded in chemistry, computer science, economics, mathematics, evolutionary and computational molecular biology, neuroscience, and physics.</p>

<br/>
The Center for Collaborative Research for an Equitable California (CCREC) officially launched Monday, February 14 coinciding with the introduction of its <a href="http://ccrec.ucsc.edu/">interactive web site</a>. UC Santa Cruz education professor Ronald D. Glass, the center's director and principal investigator, said the center&#8217;s current priority is a major fundraising campaign to expand the funding base for seed grants and longitudinal studies.<br/>
<br/>
Inaugural support comes from a $1.53 million five-year Multi-Campus Research Programs and Initiatives grant from the UC Office of the President. Although headquartered at UCSC, the research group already includes representatives from five other UC campuses, and Glass hopes to engage researchers from the other four as well.<br/>
<br/>
The proposal for the research group grew out of two facts, Glass said. First, that California's crises are interconnected. And second, that the university is not currently set up to help communities to investigate those connections and do something about them. The university is organized into disciplinary &#8220;silos&#8221; and researchers are isolated from the impact of their work, he said.<br/>
<br/>
&#160;"We plan to work across department lines, as well as across schools and divisions," Glass said. Collaboration is the key and not just within the academic sphere. CCREC seeks to link university researchers, community organizations, and policy makers "so the research can be directly geared into improving our communities," he said. In order to do this, CCREC projects will also seek to engage the public in deliberative processes that grapple with the research findings.<br/>
<br/>
"I like to think of it as reimagining both the public and the education in public education, developing learning processes that enable evidence-based decision making by communities" Glass said. "Desperate times call for a transformative vision of the university and its service mission to the state."<br/>
<br/>
Glass said the CCREC proposal emerged two years ago as the economy was at the nadir of its sudden decline. He argued that UC needed to be much more involved in helping solve the state's problems. "The university's credibility is at stake," he said.<br/>
<br/>
"Now with the budget crisis we have a remarkable opening for profound rethinking of business as usual," he said. And it will require doing more than simply "tinkering around the edges. Whether we will succeed in doing more than just tinkering isn't clear, but if we don't do it now, we probably never will."<br/>
<br/>
The research focus will take a "problem-based" approach. For instance, "we know that kids do better in school if they're not hungry, and don't have rotting teeth, or medical problems. We also know that children do better if their parents are educated and have jobs, if families have decent housing,&#8221; Glass said. Thus, solutions to the achievement gap in schools lies not just within schools, but within larger sets of issues that undermine the well-being of families and communities.<br/>
<br/>
The challenge is how to focus on solutions to the interconnected problems. Glass and his colleagues hope CCREC can help facilitate new approaches to understanding and fixing some of the endemic issues facing the state.<br/>
<br/>
CCREC is actively accepting applications for fellows, affiliates, and partners. It is also requesting proposals from faculty for planning and development grants that would support collaborative projects.<br/>

Jerry Brown's proposal to reduce state funding to the University of California by $500 million or 16.4 percent means UC Santa Cruz will need to cut its operating budget by $31 million for fiscal year 2011-2012 beginning July 1.<br/>
<br/>
UC President Mark Yudof allocated budget-cut targets to each of the system's 10 campuses; at $31 million, UCSC's share is 6 percent.<br/>
<br/>
If the 2011-12 state budget is approved as proposed, students will for the first time pay more in tuition and fees than the state provides in per-student funding. In 20 years, state support for per-student educational costs has fallen 57 percent, adjusted for inflation.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
"It's almost unthinkable to imagine what will happen," Chancellor George Blumenthal told state legislators Feb. 4 at a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/02/leg-forum-2011.html">UCSC legislative forum</a> in Santa Cruz.<br/>
<br/>
"That's the entire budget of our physical and biological sciences division, or our school of engineering and our arts division combined," commented Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway at the same forum.<br/>
<br/>
Some cuts, however, have already been absorbed, making the process no less painful but not as draconian as it might have been. Anticipating future cuts last year, UCSC administrators reduced the permanent budget instead of relying on temporary funds to tide them over to a brighter day.<br/>
<br/>
"Because of that prudent action," Galloway explained in a <a href=" http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/02/budget-reductions.html">February 7 message</a> to the campus community, "we now face an additional shortfall of approximately $19 million."<br/>
<br/>
Galloway has asked campus leaders for proposals on how to reach that figure based on the priorities of providing for the academic needs of students, teaching and research resources for faculty, and the campus's need to seek additional revenue from non-state sources.<br/>
<br/>
Academic divisions were assigned 6 percent cut targets. Those range from $635,000 in the arts division to $1.7 million for physical and biological sciences.<br/>
<br/>
All other units including the library, business and administrative services, and informational technology services face 16 percent cuts. The library alone faces a $1.5 million cut which will bring cumulative cuts over four years to 34 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Academic divisions are meeting with faculty and staff to figure out how to hit the targets.<br/>
In coming weeks, Blumenthal and Galloway plan to hold two town hall meetings to hear from students, faculty, and staff about the budget crisis.<br/>
<br/>
The situation could get worse. The proposed $500 million cut in state aid is based on an assumption that state voters will vote in June to extend a temporary increase in income, vehicle, and sales taxes. If the measure fails to make the ballot, or if voters fail to approve the extensions, the cut to the university and hence the campuses could be much greater.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
In addition, all campuses face unfunded cost increases over the next fiscal year on such things as health benefits, utilities, negotiated pay increases, and retirement fund contributions that could increase the amount that must be cut.<br/>

To join the call, dial 1 (866) 740-1260 and enter access code 459-4886#</p>
<hr/>
<p>UC Santa Cruz alumni have the rare opportunity to help shape the future of the University of California by becoming a voting member of the UC Board of Regents.</p>
<p>The position is especially influential now given the fiscal crises facing the state and the University of California.</p>
<p>UC's alumni regents are selected for two-year terms on a rotating basis from the system's 10 campuses. The successful applicant will be the fourth UC Santa Cruz alum to represent the campus on the Board of Regents. The most recent was Gary Novack, Kresge &#8217;73, who served from 2003-2005. He is the Founder and President of Pharmalogic and current president of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation. Paul Hall, Merrill &#8217;72, who served from 1991-1993 is a partner with the law firm DLA Piper, LLP. The first to serve from 1979-1981 was Allan Goodman, Stevenson &#8217;67, who is a Superior Court Judge for Los Angeles County.</p>
<p>The successful applicant will serve the first year as an alumni regent designate and secretary of the Alumni Association of the University of California (AAUC). He or she will attend all meetings and participate in policy discussions but without voting rights.</p>
<p>Then, beginning July 1, 2013, the regent designate will serve as president of the AAUC and become a full-voting member of the Board of Regents.</p>
<p>The AAUC officers' primary role is to serve as alumni representatives on the Board of Regents, representing all UC alumni. They also serve as liaisons between the AAUC member organizations, such as the UCSC Alumni Association, and the Board of Regents. The officers also provide programming leadership to the AAUC.</p>
<p>A Regent Selection Committee consisting of members of the UCSC Alumni Association executive committee will select the next UCSC alumni regent.</p>

<br/>
A UC Santa Cruz scientist, working with meteorologists at the University of Oklahoma, is using mobile storm-chasing radars to follow swarms of bats as they emerge from their caves each night to forage on insects.</p>
<p>The radar images of bats appear as distinct "blooms" of radar reflectivity and give scientists clues to their behavior, said Winifred F. Frick, a postdoctoral researcher in environmental studies at UC Santa Cruz. "Radar provides us an unprecedented tool for observing bats and birds," she said</p>
<p>Frick, a bat expert, is working with professor Thomas H. Kunz of Boston University, Phillip B. Chilson, associate professor of meteorology at the University of Oklahoma and Kenneth Howard at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Severe Storms Laboratory.</p>
<p>The team described its innovative research at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science on Saturday, February 19, in a presentation titled "Aeroecology: Transcending Boundaries Among Ecology, Meteorology, and Physics."</p>
<p>Kunz coined the term "aeroecology" two years ago to describe the interactions of organisms-&#8211;birds, bats, and insects&#8211;-in the lower atmosphere. Aeroecology can be recognized as a stand-alone discipline just as marine biology is recognized as a stand-alone discipline concerning life in the oceans, Frick said.</p>
<p>"It's very interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary in the sense that it involves bird biologists, and bat ecologists, entomologists, radar scientists, and meteorologists," she said.<br/>
<br/>
Frick received a National Science Foundation fellowship in bioinformatics to use current radar technologies to estimate densities of bat populations in the atmosphere. A year ago, she and Kunz, with whom she has worked for years, met with atmospheric and radar scientists at the University of Oklahoma in Norman, Okla., to collaborate using weather data collected by radars to study bat populations.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to truck-mounted mobile radars, Frick and her colleagues use data from 156 fixed NEXRAD weather radars around the country. Familiar as "doppler radar" from TV weather reports, these radars have recorded and archived atmospheric data every five minutes for the past 20 years.<br/>
<br/>
Scientists at the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman collect NEXRAD radar data to predict weather patterns but first they must filter out "bioscatter"--birds, bats, and insects--to focus on weather patterns, Frick said. "They want to get rid of this bioscatter clutter to make accurate storm predictions," she said.<br/>
<br/>
Now, the storm scientists are reversing the filter to instead focus on bioscatter. That offers the potential of looking back two decades to see population changes among bats, insects, and migrating birds.<br/>
<br/>
They've developed a web site called Surveillance of Aeroecology using weather Radars, or SOAR, that will be a "bioscatter portal," Frick said. There researchers can look at patterns of bat emergences from colonies, bird migrations, and even Monarch butterfly migrations.<br/>
<br/>
Last July, the team positioned a mobile, storm-chasing radar from NOAA outside Frio cave in Texas to focus on swarms of Mexican free-tail bats. Using calculations of the amount of radar backscatter from a single bat in the laboratory, the group is developing the first means to calculate aerial densities of bats as they travel on the wing.<br/>
<br/>
In August, Frick and Kunz published findings suggesting the possible extinction of the little brown bat in the northeast United States because of a fungus that disrupts the bats' hibernation cycles.<br/>

Pinckard, internationally known for her blog <a href="http://www.gamegirladvance.com/">GameGirlAdvance</a>, comes to Santa Cruz from Boston, where she worked in business development at <a href="http://www.f9e.com/">Foundation 9 Entertainment</a>, an independent game studio.</p>
<p>"UC Santa Cruz has one of the top game design research programs in the world, and I'm thrilled to join the team at its home base, the Center for Games and Playable Media," Pinckard said. "It's an incredibly exciting time for video games as we stand on the threshold of so many innovations. The potential future of this unique 21st-century medium is rich for artistic expression and technological progress, with enormous implications for our social, cultural, and economic evolution."</p>
<p>As associate director, Pinckard will join director Michael Mateas in building close ties between the computer game industry and the academic game research coming from the center's five labs, including the Expressive Intelligence Studio.</p>
<p>"We're trying something new. We have a deep portfolio of game research that we want to connect with the game industry," said Mateas, an associate professor of computer science in the Baskin School of Engineering. "Adding Jane's deep game-industry knowledge to our strong research presence makes us feel as if the sky's the limit."</p>
<p>Pinckard, who serves as vice chair of the <a href="http://www.igda.org/">International Game Developers Association</a>, has an extensive background in game journalism, having written for <em>XBox Nation, Salon,</em> and other media outlets. She co-created the <em>1Up Show,</em> a weekly video Internet show about game culture. Jane has lectured at Stanford University, Carnegie Mellon University, and Whitman College, and was a 2004 non-resident fellow in Lawrence Lessig's <em>Law in Virtual Societies</em> class at Stanford Law School.</p>
<p>Pinckard joins the Center in time to take part in its official launch symposium, "Inventing the Future of Games," on Friday, April 15. The symposium, which aims to bridge the gap between game research in academia and industry, will feature keynote speeches by <em>Sim City</em> creator Will Wright and Rod Humble, new CEO of Linden Lab, makers of the virtual world <em>Second Life.</em></p>
<p><strong>About the Center for Games and Playable Media</strong></p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz <a href="http://games.soe.ucsc.edu/">Center for Games and Playable Media</a> was formally established in 2010, building on work done since the Baskin School of Engineering began offering a degree in computer game design. The center houses the school's five game-related research labs, including the Expressive Intelligence Studio, one of the largest technical game research groups in the world.</p>
<p>The center's mission is to tackle core technology and design challenges to enable the games of the future. Addressing these challenges will help sustain the industry's economic growth, make game authorship more broadly accessible, and dramatically expand the expressive power of games. The center is committed to furthering the impact of first-class game research by building relationships between its five research labs and industry; building and releasing research-driven experimental games; facilitating UC Santa Cruz game students in joining and changing the industry; and engaging the public and the media.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="4ea55faf8072704601015f88509ebc28"><name>tom-vani-retiring</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Retirement of Vice Chancellor Vani</title><summary>After 15 years of extraordinary service to UC Santa Cruz, concluding a 31-year career with the University of California, Tom Vani, vice chancellor of Business and Administrative Services, has announced plans to retire this spring. </summary><keywords>tom vani retirement</keywords><start-date>1298365200000</start-date><display-name>Retirement of Vice Chancellor Vani</display-name><path>/2011/02/tom-vani-retiring</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/02/tom-vani-retiring</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1298399584067</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1298410779087</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption><span><br/>
</span></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><span>After 15 years of extraordinary service to UC Santa Cruz, concluding a 31-year career with the University of California, Tom Vani, vice chancellor of Business and Administrative Services, has announced plans to retire this spring.<br/>
<br/>
 Tom has provided stellar leadership during a period of vast change and considerable challenge. His numerous contributions include overseeing construction during a period of significant campus growth, guiding the campus through the production of our Long-Range Development Plan, modernizing business practices and improving efficiencies, and implementing sustainability programs that have positioned UCSC as a national leader in the field.<br/>
<br/>
 Tom has been a trusted and thoughtful colleague and campus leader. We appreciate his forward-looking approach, strategic thinking and innovations, solid management style, and wise counsel. His talents and abilities are visible to us every day, and they are even more apparent when Tom is guiding us through campus emergencies. Given the broad scope of his responsibilities, we know Tom has touched the lives of the entire campus community. On behalf of UCSC, we express our deep gratitude for his years of dedicated service.<br/>
<br/>
 We will be back in touch with details regarding how we plan to move forward. For now, please join us in congratulating Tom on his well-deserved retirement.<br/>

 &#160;<br/>
 As you are aware, UC faces severe budget cuts, which will impact the university in some very fundamental ways.&#160; It&#8217;s important that all members of the UC community understand what&#8217;s at stake and how they can help preserve UC.<br/>

<br/>
Priest, a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner, and her Washington Post colleague William M. Arkin won a <a href="http://www.liunet.edu/About/News/Univ-Ctr-PR/2011/February/Polk-PR_22Feb2011.aspx">George Polk Award for National Reporting</a> for "<a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/">Top Secret America,</a>&#8221; a two-year investigation into the enormous ecosystem of military, intelligence, and corporate interests spawned in the decade after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.<br/>
<br/>
They revealed that the business of keeping Americans safe involves 854,000 people with top-secret security clearances working on counter-terrorism and homeland-security issues for 1,271 government organizations and 1,931 private companies in some 10,000 locations across the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
The series showed how the system has grown so big and become so complex &#8212; and relies so heavily on private contractors &#8212; that it&#8217;s virtually impossible to know whether it is fulfilling its most important purpose: keeping citizens safe.<br/>
<br/>
Harris, a science correspondent for National Public Radio, is among the winners of the <a href="http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/2010/1110sja.shtml">2010 AAAS Kavli Science Journalism Awards</a> from the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). Harris won the radio award, along with NPR editor Alison Richards, for a series of reports on the Gulf oil spill.<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Harris found independent experts who concluded the spill was much larger than the official estimate of 5,000 barrels a day. The NPR reports, broadcast in May, helped spur the creation of a federal panel to review the flow-rate estimates. By mid-June, the panel was estimating the flow at 35,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil a day, in line with what NPR had found.<br/>
&#160;<br/>
"Richard Harris's reporting on the Gulf oil spill was an important and ground-breaking development in an ongoing story," said Janet Raloff of Science News, who served on the awards panel. "His coverage shows how science can shape public discourse on an important topic."<br/>
&#160;<br/>
Harris, a biology major, and Priest, a politics major, are both past winners of UC Santa Cruz Alumni Achievement Awards &#8211; <a href="http://www1.ucsc.edu/founders/">Harris in 2010</a> and <a href="http://www1.ucsc.edu/founders/2008/">Priest in 2008</a>. Harris discussed his reporting on the Gulf oil spill at the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/10/foundation-forum.html">UCSC Foundation Forum</a> in October.&#160; In 2006, Priest received the <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/03-13/priest.asp">first Distinguished Social Sciences Alumni Award</a>.<br/>
<br/>
The George Polk Awards are named for CBS correspondent George W. Polk, who was killed covering the civil war in Greece in 1948, and are administered by Long Island University.</p>
<p>Priest, a Post reporter for more than 20 years, <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/04-17/priest.asp">won the Pulitzer Prize in 2006</a> for exposing CIA "black site" prisons and <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/text.asp?pid=2093">again in 2008</a> for her articles with two colleagues on the mistreatment of wounded veterans at Walter Reed Hospital.</p>
<p>Priest will receive her award April 7 at a luncheon in New York. April 6, she will take part in the annual George Polk Seminar at Long Island University's Brooklyn campus where she will speak on &#8220;Piercing the Veil of Secrecy,&#8221; along with A.C. Thompson of ProPublica, who earned the 2010 George Polk Award for Television Reporting; and Rolling Stone&#8217;s Michael Hastings, recipient of the 2010 George Polk Award for Magazine Reporting.<br/>
<br/>
Harris and the other recipients of the 2010 AAAS Kavli Science Journalism Awards were honored at a ceremony on February 19 at the AAAS annual meeting in Washington, D.C.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/</url><title>Dana Priest's "Top Secret America" report</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.npr.org/search/index.php?searchinput=richard+harris+gulf+oil+spill</url><title>Richard Harris's Gulf oil spill reports</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="54e3fc6d8072704601015f88921d8a78"><name>ucsc-in-the-news-2-21-11</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC in the News</title><summary>Environmental studies researcher Winifred Frick's presentation on the use of weather radar to follow bats garnered widespread news coverage including the Associated Press, USA Today, Irish Times, London Times and the Santa Cruz Sentinel.  </summary><start-date>1298278800000</start-date><display-name>UCSC in the News</display-name><path>/2011/02/ucsc-in-the-news-2-21-11</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/02/ucsc-in-the-news-2-21-11</link><created-by>gwenm</created-by><created-on>1298504350683</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenm</last-modified-by><last-modified>1298504532331</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Environmental studies researcher Winifred Frick's presentation on the use of weather radar to follow bats garnered widespread news coverage including the <strong>Associated Press, <em>USA Today</em></strong><strong>,</strong> <strong><em>Irish Times</em></strong><strong>,</strong> <strong><em>London Times</em></strong> <strong>and the</strong> <strong><em>Santa Cruz Sentinel</em></strong><strong>.</strong> Frick spoke at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington, D.C.</p>

The honor recognizes Gu "for contributions to information photonics, including photorefractive devices for information processing, holographic data storage, fiber optic devices for communications and surface enhanced Raman sensors, and liquid crystal displays."</p>
<p>Gu is among 64 new OSA Fellows recognized in 2011 by the OSA Board of Directors. The designation is awarded to select members who have made significant contributions to the advancement of optics. The number of OSA Fellows is limited to no more than 10 percent of total OSA membership.</p>
<p>"OSA Fellows consistently demonstrate their strong leadership in the field of optics and photonics by pioneering innovative research and new technologies," said OSA president Christopher Dainty.</p>
<p>Gu's current research focuses on optical trapping and sensors for chemical, biological, and environmental detection. The author of more than 180 journal and conference papers, she has also published nine book chapters, coauthored a reference book, <em>Optics of Liquid Crystal Displays,</em> and coedited two technical books on photorefractive nonlinear optics and applications. In 2007, Gu was elected a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2007/04/1204.html">Fellow of SPIE</a> (the International Society for Optical Engineering). She joined the UCSC faculty in 1997.</p>
Uniting more than 106,000 professionals from 134 countries, the <a href="http://www.osa.org/">Optical Society</a> (OSA) brings together the global optics community through its programs and initiatives. Since 1916, OSA has worked to advance the common interests of the field, providing educational resources to the scientists, engineers, and business leaders who work in the field by promoting the science of light and the advanced technologies made possible by optics and photonics.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6ddfb7a98072704601015f88d373a781"><name>sbd-after-story</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> UCSC announces Baskins’ $1 million engineering gift at Scholarship Benefit Dinner </title><summary>Chancellor George Blumenthal announced a special $1 million gift from Jack and Peggy Downes Baskin for engineering graduate fellowships at UCSC's eighth annual Scholarship Benefit Dinner.</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, ucsc, scholarship benefit dinner, undergraduate, fundraising, philantrhopy, engineering</keywords><start-date>1298925000000</start-date><display-name> $1 million gift at Scholarship Benefit Dinner </display-name><path>/2011/02/sbd-after-story</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2011/02/sbd-after-story</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1298923501389</created-on><last-modified-by>dwhite1</last-modified-by><last-modified>1300469095583</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value><value>Arts</value><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value><value>Humanities</value><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value><value>Donors</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport </name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu </email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/02/images/chancellor-baskins-sbd-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/02/images/chancellor-baskins-sbd-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>chancellor-baskins-sbd-350.jpg</name><display-name>chancellor-baskins-sbd-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>50821</file-size><width>350</width><height>273</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2011/02/images/SBD-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2011/02/images/SBD-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>SBD-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>SBD-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>26416</file-size><width>80</width><height>82</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Jack Baskin and Peggy Downes Baskin with UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal at the 2011 Scholarship Benefit Dinner held at the Fairmont Hotel in San Jose.

<br/>
Nearly 350 people turned out for UCSC&#8217;s annual fundraising gala, which took place Saturday night at the Fairmont Hotel in San Jose.<br/>
<br/>
Attendees and sponsors contributed over $160,000 to directly support undergraduate student scholarships at the dinner--one of UCSC's premier fundraising events.<br/>
<br/>
In announcing the Baskins&#8217; gift, Chancellor Blumenthal noted that their generosity has already propelled the careers of more than 2,200 engineers who have graduated from the Baskin School of Engineering since 1997.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;This new gift establishes the Jack Baskin and Peggy Downes Baskin Fellowships--the largest fund for graduate-student support in the history of the campus,&#8221; said Blumenthal.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Peggy and Jack are particularly committed to bringing more women into the field of engineering, and that was on their mind when they made this gift,&#8221; he added.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;We are working hard to expand the pipeline for girls and women, with outreach to high schools and scholarships for undergraduates.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Astronaut and UCSC alumna Kathryn D. Sullivan--the first woman to walk in space--was the keynote speaker at the annual Scholarship Benefit dinner.<br/>
<br/>
Sullivan was nominated in December by President Obama to serve as Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Environmental Observation and Prediction.<br/>
<br/>
UCSC alumnus Stephen Abreu--industry contracts manager for UC San Francisco&#8217;s Diabetes Center and Immune Tolerance Network--served as emcee for the evening.<br/>
<br/>
More than $160,000 has been raised so far for undergraduate student scholarships from the dinner, and donations are still coming in.</p>
