there was a much loved and collected literary magazine associated with the University of California at Santa Cruz called <strong>kayak</strong> run by legendary editor George Hitchcock. After nineteen years and sixty-four issues the publication ended in 1989. A new boat is leaving the harbor, with a style unique in the sea of literary magazines. <strong>Catamaran Literary Reader</strong> is a racing boat run by a crew, and together we are able to sail to places on the open sea of creativity we couldn&#8217;t reach with a single paddle.&#8221;</em><br/>
<br/>
So notes founding editor Catherine Segurson in the opening pages of the inaugural issue of <a href="http://catamaranliteraryreader.com/"><em>Catamaran</em></a>&#8212;a brand new literary magazine headquartered in the new Tannery Arts Center in downtown Santa Cruz. <br/>
<br/>
Beautifully and elegantly designed with an impressive array of fiction, creative nonfiction, poetry and art, the magazine will come out quarterly, focusing on themes of the environment, artistic spirit, innovation, and freedom.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;The art, fiction, poetry, and essays are all connected by our themes, and they play off each other and tell a single story--one that resonates with creativity around the heart of our region, California and the West Coast,&#8221; said Segurson. <br/>
&#160;<br/>
&#8220;We feature a combination of well-known writers and artists with discovered talent, and the contributors are from everywhere,&#8221; she added.&#160; <br/>
<br/>
Several UCSC faculty are helping to fuel the new venture.<br/>
<br/>
UCSC lecturer and alumna Elizabeth McKenzie serves as managing editor, as well as fiction editor. She has worked as an editor for the <em>Chicago Quarterly Review</em> for 14 years, and also as a staff editor for <em>The Atlantic Monthly</em>. The author of two acclaimed novels&#8211;<em>Stop that Girl</em>, and <em>MacGregor Tells The World</em>, McKenzie received Santa Cruz&#8217;s Gail Rich Award for Writing in 2011. <br/>
<br/>
Award-winning poet Gary Young&#8212;who teaches poetry and directs the Cowell Press at UCSC&#8212;is a contributor and also serves on the advisory board of <em>Catamaran</em>. Young was named the first ever poet laureate of Santa Cruz Country in 2010, and is Santa Cruz County&#8217;s 2012 Artist of the Year. <br/>
<br/>
<em>Catamaran</em> associate editor Candace Calsoyas received her Ph.D and MA in Literature from UCSC. A long time lecturer in literature, she specializes in environmental studies and literature of the sea.<br/>
<br/>
And UCSC staff member Dan White is a contributing editor, offering up a thoughtful interview with writer T.C. Boyle in the first issue to accompany the renowned author&#8217;s short story, "The Extinction Tales".&#160; <br/>
<br/>
Segurson, who has worked at two major literary magazines (<em>Zoetrope All-Story</em>, and <em>ZYZZVA</em>) and as a visual artist, professional videographer and financial analyst, said she hopes to work with UCSC in the future to make internships available and bring writers and poets to the campus for classes and public events. <br/>
<br/>
&#8220;We've talked to some writing teachers about internships and plan to make them formally available after the second issue when submissions increase,&#8221; said Segurson. <br/>
<br/>
&#8220;As we grow, we hope to further collaborate with the Creative Writing Program in any way we can,&#8221; she added. &#8220;It is a good experience for students to have contact with a vital center for working artists, an arts mecca of sorts, in which creative writing has an integrative role.&#8221; <br/>

(Photo by Rene Paul Acosta)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>An ongoing investigation of elevated mercury levels in coastal fog in California suggests that upwelling of deep ocean water along the coast brings mercury to the surface, where it enters the atmosphere and is absorbed by fog.</p>
<p>Peter Weiss-Penzias, an environmental toxicologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who leads the investigation, emphasized that the amount of mercury in fog is not a health concern. "These are parts-per-trillion levels, so when we say elevated, that's relative to what was expected in atmospheric water," he said. "The levels measured in rain have always been fairly low, so the results from our first measurements in fog were surprising."</p>
<p>Weiss-Penzias and his team collected their first fog samples in the summer of 2011 and published their findings in a <a href="http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2012/2011GL050324.shtml">paper</a> in <em>Geophysical Research Letters</em> in February 2012. The team, including researchers at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories and CSU Monterey Bay, collected additional fog samples in the summer of 2012 and also analyzed water samples collected at different depths in Monterey Bay. Weiss-Penzias presented the latest findings in a talk at the <a href="http://fallmeeting.agu.org/2012/">American Geophysical Union meeting</a> in San Francisco on Tuesday, December 4.</p>
<p>Mercury is a highly toxic element that is released into the environment through a variety of human activities, including the burning of coal. In California, mercury mines in the coast ranges produced large amounts of elemental mercury for use in gold mining operations, leading to contamination of watersheds throughout the state. Bacteria in soil and sediments transform elemental mercury into methylmercury compounds that are especially toxic and readily absorbed by organisms.</p>
<p>Weiss-Penzias said the new results provide some clues to how methylmercury gets into coastal fog, although more research is needed to understand the processes involved. He is particularly interested in a highly volatile compound called dimethylmercury. "Dimethylmercury is more stable in the deep ocean, but we're not quite sure how it forms or where it's coming from," he said. "We found elevated levels in the surface water during upwelling, and it readily evaporates from the surface into the atmosphere, where it decomposes into monomethylmercury and gets into fog droplets."</p>
<p>When the fog moves onto the land, it collects on the leaves of redwood trees and other vegetation and drips onto the ground, depositing significant amounts of mercury onto the land. "We calculated that more methylmercury is deposited by fog than by rain, but the error bars are large," Weiss-Penzias said. He is hoping to get grant funding to conduct a more comprehensive research project.</p>
<p>The preliminary results obtained so far have relied heavily on the efforts of undergraduate researchers working with Weiss-Penzias and Russell Flegal, professor of microbiology and environmental toxicology at UC Santa Cruz. Two of those undergraduates will be presenting posters on their work at the AGU meeting. Cruz Ortiz, who has continued working in the lab since his graduation earlier this year, has been looking at mercury concentrations in insects in coastal areas subject to fog deposition. His preliminary data indicate higher concentrations of mercury in some insects in the summer, when coastal fog is common, than in February and March. The other poster looks at mercury in sediments from Monterey Bay and is presented by Rene Paul Acosta, now a graduate student at Purdue University.</p>
<p>"There is so little data on this now, we're just trying to fill in the map to improve our understanding of the cycling of mercury in the environment," Weiss-Penzias said. "We want to know its sources and sinks and transformations."</p>
<p>Methylmercury becomes increasingly concentrated in organisms higher up the food chain, and mercury levels in some predatory fish are high enough to raise health concerns. This contamination of ocean fish is the result of biological sequestering of mercury that has been accumulating in the oceans since the beginning of the industrial revolution in the 19th century. Similarly, the mercury that moves from ocean waters into fog is probably not fresh pollution, but the result of the historical legacy of mercury pollution from coal burning and other sources, Weiss-Penzias said.</p>
<p>"It is a bit of a mystery where it's coming from, but I think what we're seeing is a large-scale phenomenon that has to do with upwelling of deep ocean water along the coast," he said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="68009fcc80727046795b6081405fab50"><name>path-recruitment</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCPath Center Open Recruitment Announcement</title><summary>Recruitment has opened for new career opportunities at the UCPath Center.</summary><start-date>1354611600000</start-date><display-name>UCPath Center Open Recruitment Announcement</display-name><path>/2012/12/path-recruitment</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/12/path-recruitment</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1354659569549</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1354659589788</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>The UC Office of the President has asked campuses to help announce the opening of recruitment for positions in the new UCPath Center in Riverside.

<br/>
Abby Brown's research focuses on empowerment and gender equality in water and sanitation in the United States and abroad. She is also an activist for public sanitation facilities, working with a Portland, Ore. volunteer advocacy group known as <a href="http://www.phlush.org/">PHLUSH</a> (Public Hygiene Lets Us Stay Human). The group selected her for a travel grant provided by the <a href="http://worldtoilet.org/wto/">World Toilet Organization</a> for the trip to South Africa where she will speak on toilet needs in North America, including public restroom design, emergency sanitation, and ecological sanitation.<br/>
<br/>
She is documenting the World Toilet Summit proceedings taking place December 4-6 by live blogging at <a href="http://www.phlush.org/">plush.org</a> and&#160; tweeting at <a href="https://twitter.com/waterfortheages">@WaterfortheAges</a>. This year is the first that the summit has been held in Africa. <br/>
<br/>
In the Monterey Bay Area, Brown is collaborating with an effort by the Service Learning Institute at California State University, Monterey Bay, to provide toilets for the homeless in Salinas. <br/>
<br/>
Brown is an environmental studies graduate of Evergreen State College and holds an M.S. in water resources policy and management from Oregon State University.<br/>
<br/>
Improved sanitation has been shown to reduce mortality in developing countries, UCSC Sociology Department chair Ben Crow said. "There is also a growing movement in many countries supporting the provision of access to safe sanitation for the more than 2 billion people worldwide who lack it," he said.&#160; <br/>
<br/>
The World Toilet Organization was founded in 2001 to improve sanitation conditions globally through advocacy, inventive technology, education, and building local marketplace opportunities. Sanitation plays an important role in ending poverty, creating gender equality, and keeping children in school, the organization says. <br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="6d47a5368072704662cc540b4fb3287a"><name>tony-hill-nominations</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Nominations for the 2013 Tony Hill Memorial Award</title><summary>The campus is once again inviting nominations for the 2013 5th Annual Tony Hill Memorial Award.</summary><start-date>1354698000000</start-date><display-name>Nominations for the 2013 Tony Hill Memorial Award</display-name><path>/2012/12/tony-hill-nominations</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/12/tony-hill-nominations</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1354748110075</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1354748110075</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><span>The campus is once again inviting nominations for the 2013 5th Annual Tony Hill Memorial Award.</span> <span><br/>

(Photo by Winifred Frick)</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Surprising study shows complex relationships in coevolution of plants and pollinators</article-subhead><article-text><p>Of the two bat species known to visit the flowers of the cardon cactus in Baja California, one depends entirely on nectar and is highly specialized to feed from the flowers, which are adapted for pollination by bats. The other is an insect-eating bat best known for its ability to hear the footsteps of large insects and scorpions and capture them on the ground.</p>
<p>In a surprising result, scientists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, have found that the insect-eating pallid bat is a more effective pollinator of the cactus flowers than the nectar-feeding specialist, the lesser long-nosed bat.</p>
<p>"The lesser long-nosed bat is highly specialized for nectar-feeding and was thought to be the primary pollinator of the cardon cactus. But when we measured their effectiveness, we found that the pallid bat actually delivers about 13 times as much pollen per visit," said Winifred Frick, a research scientist at UC Santa Cruz. Frick is first author of a <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/668595">paper</a> on the new findings published online in <em>American Naturalist.</em></p>
<p>The study highlights the complex nature of the mutually beneficial relationships between plants and their pollinators, which in most cases have evolved together over long periods of time. There are often conflicts of interest between the partners, according to coauthor Kathleen Kay, assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"What is actually happening in terms of how species are mutually interacting can be more complicated than what meets the eye," Kay said. "You would think the coevolved species would be a better pollinator than a naive interloper. But the adaptations for nectar-feeding of the lesser long-nosed bat are to enable it to get more nectar, not for it to do a better job pollinating."</p>
<p>Frick said several factors may explain the difference between the two bat species in pollination effectiveness. The lesser long-nosed bat is able to hover at the open cactus flowers and uses its long tongue to extract the nectar, transferring pollen from one flower to another in the process. The pallid bat, in contrast, has to land on the flowers and plunge its head deep inside to get to the nectar, resulting in longer visits and more copious accumulations of pollen on its head. In addition, the lesser long-nosed bat relies on pollen as a source of protein and regularly grooms itself during a night of flower visits, removing some of the pollen from its fur and eating it.</p>
<p>Frick, a bat ecologist, had observed pallid bats visiting cardon cactus flowers during earlier research projects in the area and knew that the bats often had pollen on them. For the new study, she teamed up with Kay, an expert in pollination biology and plant evolution. They monitored cactus flowers at 14 study sites in Baja California, working with a team of student assistants from Mexico and UC Santa Cruz. The cardon cactus is a large columnar cactus and is the dominant plant species in the study area. When the researchers saw a bat visit a flower, they would identify the species, climb a ladder to the flower, remove the stigma, and count the number of pollen grains the bat had delivered. They also took data on the number of flower visits by each of the two species at each study site.</p>
<p>The results showed that the pallid bats not only delivered more pollen per visit on average, but in some areas were frequent enough visitors to be more effective pollinators overall than the lesser long-nosed bats.</p>
<p>Plants that are adapted for bat pollination have large, sturdy flowers that bloom at night. The lesser long-nosed bat belongs to a large family of nectar-feeding bats that are important pollinators, especially in tropical habitats. The pallid bat, in contrast, is the only nectar feeder known in its mostly insect-eating family, which is the largest and most widespread family of bats.</p>
<p>"A lot of pollinators come from lineages that are quite old and have been coevolving with plants for a long time," Kay said. "You might think that a new pollinator would not be a good pollinator, but in this case it's actually a better pollinator because it's not well adapted for nectar-feeding. It's exciting to get a glimpse of what the initial stages might be in the evolution of a novel feeding behavior."</p>
<p>Frick said she has video of a pallid bat attacking a large moth on a flower, so it's not hard to imagine how the insect-eating pallid bats might have discovered the sweet nectar hidden inside cactus flowers.</p>
<p>Kay noted that many animals that visit flowers are just feeding without pollinating the flowers or otherwise benefiting the plants. There are also examples of invasive pollinators that disrupt a coevolved plant-pollinator relationship and do a worse job of pollination. "In this case it's the evolutionarily newer pollinator doing a better job, and I haven't seen that before," she said.</p>
<p>The lesser long-nosed bats were effective pollinators of cardon cactus flowers at many of the study sites. But the study found considerable variation between sites, and because the lesser long-nosed bat is migratory, there may be variability from year to year as well, Frick said. The greater variability of the migratory lesser long-nosed bats could make the resident pallid bats especially important as pollinators of cardon cactus.</p>
<p>"The lesser long-nosed bat is an adequate pollinator, but there is a lot of variation in where they occur. We would like to look at that variation over several years," Frick said.&#160;</p>
<p>In addition to Frick and Kay, the coauthors of the paper include Ryan Price, who worked on the project for his senior thesis and graduated from UCSC with a degree in environmental studies, and Paul Heady of the Central Coast Bat Research Group. Funding for this project was provided by the UC Institute for Mexico and the United States (UC MEXUS) and the Central Coast Bat Research Group. Frick was supported by National Science Foundation grants (DBI 0905881 and DEB 1115895).</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="716e0bed807270460c54c0ae8d1ae723"><name>project-grad</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Working with families and students to create college-going communities </title><summary>For some it was the distance from home, others the redwoods, and still others the chance to work in computer game design.

Tuesday, 15 UC Santa Cruz students, all graduates of San Fernando High School, had the chance to tell one of the people responsible for their matriculation how they ended up at UCSC.<br/>
<br/>
That person, Ford Roosevelt (College 8, '79, sociology and teaching credential), was in Santa Cruz to invite them to lunch and see how they are doing.<br/>
<br/>
Social Sciences Dean Sheldon Kamieniecki hosted the lunch and was joined by Michelle Whittingham, associate vice chancellor for enrollment management and interim director of financial aid.<br/>
<br/>
Roosevelt is president and CEO of Project GRAD Los Angeles, an organization that works with first-generation college students from low-income backgrounds to help them enroll in and graduate from college.&#160; He's a former middle school teacher who joined Project GRAD LA in 2004.<br/>
<br/>
He also ran a preschool in Santa Cruz and once worked in the UCSC admissions office in the 1980s extolling the virtues of the campus in visits to high schools around the state.&#160; Roosevelt loves UC Santa Cruz.<br/>
<br/>
Each of the six Project GRAD sites around the country is an independent, non-profit responsible for its own fundraising and relationship with local school districts. The organization was founded in Houston in the 1990s and grew from a Houston scholarship program first started in 1989.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
In the Los Angeles Unified School District, Project GRAD works with four middle schools and San Fernando High in northeast Los Angeles County. It begins working with students and their families in middle school and high school, and then provides scholarships and support through completion of college. Since the graduating class of 2003, 290 San Fernando High students involved with Project GRAD LA have graduated from college.<br/>
<br/>
Fernando Carrillo, a third-year computer game design major, explained that if students keep their end of the bargain when they enter high school &#8211; take required courses, keep up good grades, and complete two college institutes &#8211; Project GRAD will keep its deal to help with deadline reminders, counseling, and scholarships.<br/>
<br/>
UCSC was Carrillo's top choice because of the game design program. Janette Perez, a second-year psychology major at Kresge, liked the distance from southern California. Others said being 350 miles from home caused some homesickness. Vanessa Mendoza, an environmental studies major, said UCSC was her top choice as soon as she visited and saw the campus.<br/>
<br/>
Being a part Project GRAD means getting help from previous students and helping those coming along behind. Carrillo remembers getting advice from an older student when he was first on campus. This year he was able to return the favor to a recent San Fernando High grad and new banana slug worried over financial aid matters.<br/>
<br/>
"We follow them through to graduation," Roosevelt said. "The idea is to create and help sustain a community that has college-going as its objective.&#160;<br/>

graduate of the Social Documentation Program at UC Santa Cruz--has been named the winner of the 2012 HBO and National Association of Latino Independent Producers (NALIP) Documentary Film Award.<br/>
<br/>
Bautista received the award for her film, <em>Justice For My Sister,</em> which she originally created for her master&#8217;s thesis at UC Santa Cruz.<br/>
<br/>
Bautista continued to work on the film after graduation, employing fellow UCSC SocDoc graduate Juan Mejia (2007) as her cinematographer.<br/>
<br/>
HBO and NALIP created the $10,000 cash award in 2009 for Latino filmmakers to support the growth of social commentary by Latino documentarians.</p>
<p>With an emphasis on social change, films are judged based on the uniqueness of their subject matter, the professional quality of the film, and the tone structure, and style.<br/>
<br/>
The winner and two finalists in this year&#8217;s awards were selected by a panel of professional filmmakers and the HBO Documentary Films executives.<br/>
<br/>
Bautista&#8217;s award-winning film is a David versus Goliath story about the determination of one woman to see that her sister&#8217;s murder did not go unpunished.<br/>
<br/>
Adela, 27, left home for work one day and never returned. Her ex-boyfriend had beat her until she was unrecognizable and left her at the side of the road.<br/>
<br/>
In a heroic effort to see that Adela's killer is held accountable, her 34-year-old sister Rebeca takes on Guatemala's notoriously corrupt legal system, ultimately emerging as a leader in her rural community with the enduring message that justice is possible.<br/>
<br/>
The film's violence prevention campaign led to the formation of a youth-led outreach team with chapters in Guatemala and Los Angeles, a text-messaging service in Guatemala, and more than 150 screenings throughout Guatemala.<br/>
<br/>
Bautista&#8217;s film has also been screened at events co-hosted by the Central American Consulates of Los Angeles, the LAPD, East Los Angeles Women's Center, Interface Children and USC&#8217;s Family Services.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Kimberly's determination to use documentary in defense of Guatemalan women is exemplary, and just the sort of dedication we prize in Social Documentation students,&#8221; noted professor B. Ruby Rich, director of the Social Documentation Program at UC Santa Cruz.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Kim fought to bring their story to the screen and to use social media to further her message. We couldn't be prouder of her,&#8221; she added.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Rich said that she recently attended a public screening of the film in San Francisco this fall.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Several current SocDoc students attended on their own volition, and they were so inspired by her dedication--the audience gave her a standing ovation.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;SocDoc exists to equip students to employ cameras, stories, and perspectives in the cause of social justice,&#8221; Rich added. &#8220;Guatemala will be a better place for women thanks to Kimberly Bautista.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Bautista, a Los Angeles-based Colombian and Irish-American filmmaker, served as director, producer, writer, co-cinematographer, and co-editor for the film.<br/>
<br/>
She has been doing media arts work in Guatemala since 2008, examining the effects of the country&#8217;s nearly four-decade internal conflict.</p>
<p>In 2006, Bautista founded and directed the Intercultural Web Exchange, a video pen-pal web program between young women in Quito, Ecuador and young Chicana women in Pomona, California. The project lasted over three years and culminated in a college prep opportunity for the participants.<br/>
<br/>
Bautista was a Princess Grace Honorarium recipient in 2008 and a Latino Producers Academy Fellow in 2010.<br/>

<p>Captured by 50 automatic, motion-triggered cameras, the images are all in a day's work for students sorting through a slide show of animal life for a research project that aims to answer a thorny question: How does human development affect the notoriously solitary and secretive mountain lion?</p>
<p>In the name of science, students also may be called upon to scramble up a brushy hillside behind braying dogs on the scent of a big cat, or hike through the forest in search of cougar kills. They may be asked to analyze video that will help refine a state-of-the-art tracking collar developed at UCSC. Sometimes, they may even be requested to extract a pesky skunk from a puma trap.</p>
<p>"Two years ago, I never would have dreamed I'd being doing anything like this," said Lee Hibbeler, a 22-year-old environmental science and biology major interning with the project, "but I feel like this is completely where I am meant to be."</p>
<p>The Puma Project operates out of a few spartan offices in the Interdisciplinary Sciences Building on campus, although its research range encompasses Santa Cruz, Santa Clara, and San Mateo counties.</p>
<p>Associate Environmental Studies Professor Chris Wilmers started the project in 2008 after he became interested in the way cougars live so close to the Bay Area's urban sprawl. It's not that these creatures prefer human company; it's just that human beings keep poking their shoulders into mountain lion territory, with far-ranging results.</p>
<p>"Habitat fragmentation has a huge impact on species, and the most vulnerable species are the large predators," said Wilmers, who once studied the wolves of Yellowstone Park. "There wasn't a lot of research on how animals adapt and respond" to human development.</p>
<p>That's why Wilmers stepped in. With major funding from the National Science Foundation and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation&#8212;along with help from the California Department of Fish and Game&#8212;the study has monitored 36 animals to understand how roads, construction, and farming have affected mountain lions' health, dietary needs, and range. A dedicated group of graduate and undergraduate students, along with field biologist Paul Houghtaling, help drive the research, with aid from a pioneering tracking collar developed at UCSC.</p>
<p>The collar, a 1&#189;-inch wide rubber strap with two small grey containers, carries a GPS device to mark a mountain lion's location and an accelerometer that allows scientists to better interpret the animal's behaviors.</p>
<p>The collar was developed with the aid of an $820,000 National Science Foundation grant and the collaboration of Wilmers, Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Terrie Williams, and Associate Professor of Engineering Gabriel Elkaim.</p>
<p>Now in its third incarnation, the tracking collar allows researchers to record an animal's activities and lay that over data about vegetation, geography, and the location of buildings and roads. The collars churn out a steady stream of information that lets researchers know whether the creatures are resting, hunting, or even wandering nearly to San Francisco, as one cougar did.</p>
<p>The result is a growing understanding of an animal that needs a range of 15 to 150 square miles to survive, along with data that could lead to more effective policy decisions to minimize conflict between animals and humans.</p>
<p>For instance, the project honed in on two places where cougars have crossed busy Highway 17, sometimes with fatal results. The finding may help Cal Trans develop wildlife-crossing culverts in places that will provide these animals with the best chance to escape an encounter with a 65-mph machine.</p>
<p>Sitting on a quiet balcony near the project's lab, 30-year-old graduate student Yiwei Wang talked about work currently being done to refine the tracking collar's information stream. She and others are correlating the activities of captured cougars with data received from their tracking collars.</p>
<p>According to Wang, an estimated 80-100 adult mountain lions roam the Central Coast's hills&#8212;some in sight of the office buildings and sprawling homes of Silicon Valley. They slip across running trails, saunter through rural neighborhoods, and yowl into the forest looking for a mate&#8212;a world most urban dwellers never see.</p>
<p>The fact these animals wander the edges of one of the world's technology centers makes it natural for social media to play a big role in the project. Videos, photos, tweets, and even a Facebook game are all part of the project's scientific outreach.</p>
<p>Undergraduate intern Hibbeler is working on an interactive website for her senior project and hopes to go to graduate school some day. Her experience with the Puma Project changed her life, she said.</p>
<p>It taught her teamwork, patience, and, most importantly, it gave her a confidence she never had.</p>
<p>"I went from someone being lost in the crowd at UCSC to organizing a talk by Chris (Wilmers) where 50 to 100 people showed up," she said. "I'm very passionate about this."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://santacruzpumas.org/puma-tracker/</url><title>Check out the Puma Tracker</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="769348d58072704669705cd8bb8a1f77"><name>jeltema-40u40</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Physicist Tesla Jeltema honored by Silicon Valley Business Journal</title><summary>Physicist Tesla Jeltema is among 40 accomplished people under the age of 40 recognized this year by the Silicon Valley Business Journal.</summary><keywords>Tesla Jeltema, 40 under 40, SVBJ, women in physics, women in science</keywords><start-date>1354870800000</start-date><display-name>Physicist Tesla Jeltema honored by Silicon Valley Business Journal</display-name><path>/2012/12/jeltema-40u40</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/12/jeltema-40u40</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1354904062099</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1354904308194</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Physics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value><value>Research</value><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Community</value><value>Staff</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Donors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/12/images/jeltema-200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/12/images/jeltema-200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jeltema-200.jpg</name><display-name>jeltema-200.jpg</display-name><file-size>38244</file-size><width>200</width><height>233</height></image><image-alt>tesla jeltema</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/12/images/jeltema-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/12/images/jeltema-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>jeltema-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>jeltema-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>18923</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>tesla jeltema</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Tesla Jeltema</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UCSC physicist Tesla Jeltema is among 40 accomplished people under the age of 40 recognized this year by the <em><a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/">Silicon Valley/San Jose Business Journal</a></em>. A special "<a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/blog/2012/12/meet-this-years-40-under-40.html">40 Under 40</a>" feature in the December 7 issue of the <em>Business Journal</em> includes profiles of the honorees, who are recognized for their achievements and the impact they have on their communities.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/print-edition/2012/12/07/40u40-tesla-jeltema.html">Jeltema</a> came to UC Santa Cruz in 2007 as a Morrison Fellow at UC Observatories and joined the faculty as an assistant professor of physics in 2011. Her research focuses on astronomical probes of dark matter and dark energy, the two great mysteries of modern cosmology. Jeltema is affiliated with two major collaborations in astronomy and astrophysics, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey. She was the first to put constraints on dark matter models via x-ray observations, and she is leading the Fermi collaboration's efforts to discover gamma ray emissions from galaxy clusters.</p>
<p>Jeltema is actively committed to promoting the success of women in science and academia. She is involved in an online mentorship program called <a href="https://piazza.com/witson">Women in Technology Sharing Online</a> (WitsOn) that connects college students with prominent women in science, technology, engineering and math. She also started a mentoring program for women in physics at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The "40 Under 40" honorees were celebrated at a reception in Santa Clara on Thursday, December 6.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="76bf88918072704669705cd84e2939b8"><name>ucsc-dave-brubeck</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>The UCSC-Dave Brubeck connection</title><summary>In the early '80s, jazz great Dave Brubeck slipped onto the UC Santa Cruz campus for a visit that would remain a nearly invisible slice of university history—until the pianist and composer's recent death.</summary><keywords>Dave Brubeck, Monte Brill</keywords><start-date>1355130000000</start-date><display-name>UCSC-Dave Brubeck connection</display-name><path>/2012/12/ucsc-dave-brubeck</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/12/ucsc-dave-brubeck</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1354906961989</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1371579396975</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Art</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Donors</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Banana Slug Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/12/images/Brubeck on campus.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/12/images/Brubeck on campus.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Brubeck on campus.jpg</name><display-name>Brubeck on campus.jpg</display-name><file-size>113312</file-size><width>300</width><height>214</height></image><image-alt>Dave Brubeck visits Porter sculpture</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/12/images/Brubeck on campus thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/12/images/Brubeck on campus thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>Brubeck on campus thumb.jpg</name><display-name>Brubeck on campus thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>25986</file-size><width>72</width><height>72</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Dave Brubeck visits Porter sculpture</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Jazz great the late Dave Brubeck at the dedication of a red-metal sculpture outside Porter College (then College Five) entitled "Take Five," created by alum&#160;Monte Brill (at right).

<p>The occasion for the music legend's appearance was the dedication of a red-metal sculpture that sits outside what is known as the "bat caves" of Porter College's B Building residence hall.</p>
<p>Seven or eight students attended the event. There was champagne. Not a single administrator or faculty member had been invited.</p>
<p>"He (Brubeck) was just a gracious, nice man," said Monte Brill, now 53 and the artist behind the sculpture, which was completed in 1982 and titled "Take Five"&#8212;a name shared with the Brubeck Quartet's famous instrumental. "He was just happy to help a college kid live out a piece of his dream."</p>
<p>According to Brill, it was "1984 or so" when his then-girlfriend heard Brubeck was in town for a concert at the Kuumbwa Jazz center. Somehow, said the Porter College art history major, his girlfriend persuaded Brubeck's manager to bring the legendary jazzman to campus for a sculpture dedication.</p>
<p>Brubeck arrived to find Brill, five or six of his hallmates, a student photographer, and Brill's girlfriend holding a couple of bottles of bubbly. Brubeck dutifully cut the red ribbon and sat on the springy sculpture, which resembles crashing waves or chaise longue chairs, depending on a visitor's point of view.</p>
<p>"He liked how they sprang up and down," Brill said.</p>
<p>Now a clockmaker/musician and living in Redwood Valley in Northern California, Brill said he named his sculpture "Take Five" partly as a tribute to Brubeck, whose music was an almost steady backbeat to Brill's college life. However, he noted, the title had two other references: the 1981 name change from College Five to Porter College (thus taking away "Five") and the idea of taking a short break.</p>
<p>Today, the 12-foot-long, two-section sculpture sits in a small graveled yard in the shadow of redwoods, carefully preserved during the renovation of Porter A and B residence halls, according to James Blaine, college programs coordinator for Porter.</p>
<p>However, most people never knew that an icon of the jazz world had once bounced on its sheet-metal surface&#8212;until the notice of Brubeck's death was posted on UCSC's Facebook page this week and another alum recalled a faint memory of Brubeck paying a visit to campus.</p>
<p>"He made an art student's day," Brill said of Brubeck and that magical afternoon. "He made me believe in my own artistry. He kind of anointed it."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="774d87c78072704669705cd8bcf6d807"><name>in-memoriam-kevin-ebbert</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC graduate killed during tour of duty in Afghanistan</title><summary>A weekend memorial is scheduled for Kevin Ebbert, a UCSC graduate and U.S. Navy SEAL, who was killed in Afghanistan late last month.</summary><start-date>1354870800000</start-date><display-name>In Memoriam--Kevin Ebbert</display-name><path>/2012/12/in-memoriam-kevin-ebbert</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/12/in-memoriam-kevin-ebbert</link><created-by>jrburns</created-by><created-on>1354916267908</created-on><last-modified-by>jrburns</last-modified-by><last-modified>1354929039626</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>In Memoriam</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>UCSC Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/12/images/kevin-ebbert.296.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/12/images/kevin-ebbert.296.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kevin-ebbert.296.jpg</name><display-name>kevin-ebbert.296.jpg</display-name><file-size>90581</file-size><width>296</width><height>364</height></image><image-alt>Photo of Kevin Ebbert</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/12/images/kevin-ebbert.80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/12/images/kevin-ebbert.80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>kevin-ebbert.80.jpg</name><display-name>kevin-ebbert.80.jpg</display-name><file-size>25856</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Photo of Kevin Ebbert</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Kevin Ebbert (Photo: Eureka Times-Standard)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Memorial scheduled for Sunday, December 9, at Humboldt</article-subhead><article-text><p>A weekend memorial will be held for Kevin Ebbert, a UCSC graduate, who was killed in action in Afghanistan late last month.</p>
<p>Ebbert, a Navy SEAL from Arcata,&#160;will be honored this Sunday, December 9, from noon to 2 p.m., at Humboldt State University.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old SEAL and corpsman was killed on November 24 while &#8220;supporting stability operations in Uruzgan Province, Afghanistan,&#8221; according to a Department of Defense press release. The region is a mountainous area in the center of the country.</p>
<p>In an obituary in the <em>Eureka Times-Standard,</em> Ebbert is described as a person who had a passion for music and reading, while also enjoying backpacking, rafting, and Ultimate Frisbee.</p>
<p>He graduated from UCSC in 2003 with a bachelor's degree in music and a minor in jazz. Affiliated with Kresge College, Ebbert first enrolled on campus as a freshman in fall 1998.</p>
<p>"I was devastated to learn of this," said Anatole Leikin, a UCSC professor of music. "I remember Kevin from my music theory classes. He was a talented and hard-working student."</p>
<p>"On behalf of the UC Santa Cruz campus, I extend my heartfelt condolences to Kevin's wife, to his mother, and to his other family members and friends," UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal said. "We all are saddened by this news and are profoundly thankful for Kevin's service to our country."</p>

<p>The device will enable efficient and flexible use of sunlight collected by solar concentrators, according to principal investigator Nobuhiko Kobayashi, associate professor of electrical engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz. It is based on a unique thin-film waveguide that collects sunlight and transforms it to match an optical fiber with minimum losses compared to traditional light-concentrating optics.</p>
<p>The project is a collaboration between the <a href="http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a> and two Silicon Valley companies, Antropy Inc. and Tango Systems Inc. Antropy, founded in 2007 by Ernest Demaray, is based in Portola Valley, Calif. Demaray, who earned his Ph.D. in chemistry at UC Santa Cruz in 1978 and has been a Silicon Valley entrepreneur for several decades, is the inventor and owner of a portfolio of more than 50 patents. <a href="http://www.tangosystemsinc.com">Tango Systems</a>, based in San Jose, is an equipment company specializing in production sputtering systems and thin-film deposition services.</p>
<p>The project involves a new way to use solar concentrators, which are typically deployed in massive projects in which a large array of mirrors concentrates solar energy on a linear absorber or a tower, where absorbed heat is collected for generating electricity. Kobayashi's plan is to collect concentrated sunlight and transmit it through optical fibers to be stored or used remotely without significant losses.</p>
<p>"The problem is that when you look at these two optical components, a gigantic mirror and a tiny optical fiber, the coupling efficiency is very low," Kobayashi said. "We are developing a very special optical coupling device that enables efficient collection of high-power, concentrated solar energy. This optical coupling device could change the way we handle solar light."</p>
<p>The novel optical coupling device is enabled by special optical thin films based on Demaray's patents. He began collaborating with Kobayashi in 2010 to develop applications for optical films with high refractive index and low extinction coefficient. Tango Systems is providing the specialized thin-film deposition system needed to manufacture the optical coupling device.</p>
<p>"This thin-film technology allows us to design an efficient optical coupling device that can't be made with existing materials," Kobayashi said. "People have been trying to make an efficient optical coupling device for decades, and now we have the technology and knowledge in materials science, as well as the manufacturing technology to do it."</p>
<p>Kobayashi's project is among 66 cutting-edge research projects funded by the highly competitive ARPA-E program this year. ARPA-E seeks out transformational, breakthrough technologies that show fundamental technical promise but are too early for private-sector investment. These projects have the potential to produce game-changing breakthroughs in energy technology, form the foundation for entirely new industries, and have large commercial impacts.</p>
<p>"With ARPA-E and all of the Department of Energy&#8217;s research and development efforts, we are determined to attract the best and brightest minds at our country's top universities, labs and businesses to help solve the energy challenges of this generation," said energy secretary Steven Chu in announcing the awards. "The 66 projects selected today represent the true mission of ARPA-E: swinging for the fences and trying to hit home runs to support development of the most innovative technologies and change what&#8217;s possible for America&#8217;s energy future."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8b3d3c36807270465f253dfba8bf4701"><name>cowell-press</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Type and literature and poetry</title><summary>UCSC's Cowell Press, a decades-old program, uses hands-on creativity to teach students the traditional arts of typography and printing.</summary><keywords>Cowell Press, Gary Young</keywords><start-date>1357549200000</start-date><display-name>Cowell Press</display-name><path>/2012/12/cowell-press</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/12/cowell-press</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1355250744300</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1371579921952</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name><value>Art</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Donors</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Banana Slug Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/12/images/jimenez-reubi-thumb.jpeg</path><link>site://news/2012/12/images/jimenez-reubi-thumb.jpeg</link><site>news</site><name>jimenez-reubi-thumb.jpeg</name><display-name>Jimenez-Reubi thumb.jpeg</display-name><file-size>32269</file-size><width>72</width><height>72</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Reubi Jimenez</image-thumb-alt><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>UCSC's Cowell Press, a decades-old program, uses hands-on creativity to teach students the traditional arts of typography and printing</article-subhead><article-text><div class="callout-right"><a href="cowell-press-slideshow.xml"><img alt="See a slideshow of photos from the Cowell Press" height="254" src="images/cowell-press-slideshow.jpg" width="380"/></a></div>
<p>An hour away from Silicon Valley and a 10-minute walk from researchers studying cancer and cosmology, UC Santa Cruz anthropology major Ruebi Jimenez is toiling over a centuries-old art.</p>
<p>She runs her fingertips over lines of raised metal letters as she ponders spacing issues, typeface problems, and the slight menace of the finger-snagging Vandercook printing press in front of her. She doesn't want to make a mistake.</p>
<p>"This makes me slow down and be engaged with type and literature and poetry in a workshop setting," says Jimenez, who is part of a decades-old program on campus: the Cowell Press. "That's why it is so attractive to me."</p>
<p>Taught by poet and master printer Gary Young, and housed in what was once a two-car garage at the Cowell College Provost's House, the Cowell Press feels like a step back in time. Old letterpress machines sigh. Wooden type drawers clack gently. A long blade cuts thick paper with a hiss.</p>
<p>"It's one of the few places where you can still use your hands," says Young, as he surveys a shoulder-to-shoulder mix of students setting type, carving linoleum blocks and working presses that look close to antiques. "We're using muscle memory as a tool for aesthetic choices and, in this world, we don't get to do that too often."</p>
<p>According to a 2005 oral history, the Cowell Press had its start in the experimental teaching environment that was early UC Santa Cruz. A student named Peter Manston discovered an abandoned platen press in an old Cowell Ranch outbuilding and, in 1973, led a student-taught seminar on letterpress printing.</p>
<p>The next year, respected San Francisco typographer Jack Stauffacher was given a Regents professorship and began to teach typography at Cowell College. Later, he was joined on campus by poet, printer and former Dominican monk William Everson, who established the Lime Kiln Press. Typography and printing as a creative medium became part of the UCSC experience.</p>
<p>Today, students from a wide array of majors &#8212; from environmental science to psychology to anthropology &#8212; create whimsical posters, assemble one-of-a-kind books, set words to paper, and indulge in a kind of hands-on creativity they say they don't find in lectures and labs.</p>
<p>"It harkens back to those early days of experimentation at UCSC," says Young, who oversees the press with a poet's eye and a craftsman's skills &#8212; both necessary to keep the program and the thumping old presses running.</p>
<p>Young, who graduated from UCSC in 1973 and began teaching on campus in 2005, sees himself as a facilitator and enthusiast for the creative appetites of those in his class. He describes how students discover a poem's "heft" by setting it in type, of their fascination with an old-fashioned art, of the life skills the class teaches.</p>
<p>&#160;"Students pull proofs, redesign, pull proofs, redesign again," he says as he stands in front of a bank of windows that fills the room with light. "They have to make choices. It is one of the fundamental questions of morality. You make choices and the choices matter. You have to live with them."</p>
<p>That idea is one of the things that appeals to Megan Barrett, a senior art history major from Porter College.</p>
<p>"I've learned a lot of patience," she says. "I've gained more awareness of what I'm doing. You have to take things more seriously because you recognize that if you don't do it right, you have to do it all over again."</p>
<p>As Barrett works, Young weaves his way over the ink-stained concrete floor, pausing to troubleshoot a project that isn't printing clearly, to examine type that may need to be rehabilitated at his own studio in Bonny Doon.</p>
<p>"Beautiful," he says of an accordion-style, fine-art book being finished by recent graduate Nicole Albuquerque, an environmental studies major from Cowell College.</p>
<p>Albuquerque smiles. "I didn't know about the press until my senior year," she says. "But when I found it, it was magical."</p>
<h2>Keep the presses rolling</h2>
<p>Cowell Press and the courses in the book arts are supported entirely by donated funds. In a first step toward securing the future of the press, Cowell College is kicking off a fundraising effort to create an endowment. Establishing an endowment requires initial funding of $25,000. The ultimate goal is to have an endowment of $1.5 million, which would provide adequate funds for the college to keep the presses rolling, according to Cowell College Provost Faye Crosby.</p>
<p>"Now, as UCSC approaches its 50th year of existence, is the time for us to celebrate our glorious past and turn to the task of securing the same benefits for generations to come," said Crosby.</p>

Here&#8217;s a look back at a few highlights of the year at UCSC.</p>
<p><strong>Science and technology on the cutting edge</strong></p>
<p>&#8226; UC Santa Cruz scientists helped organize an ambitious international <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/07/jfast-success.html">ocean drilling expedition</a> to measure properties of the fault that caused the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, installing a new observatory beneath the seafloor at the site of the devastating earthquake.</p>
<p>&#8226; UCSC&#8217;s team of accomplished physicists were involved in <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/07/higgs-boson.html">experiments at the Large Hadron Collider</a> that produced evidence of the long-sought Higgs boson, a key part of the theory that explains the masses of fundamental particles.</p>
<p>&#8226; UCSC astronomy and astrophysics professor Sandra Faber was one of a dozen researchers <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/12/national-science-medal.html">selected by President Obama to receive the National Medal of Science</a>.&#160;Faber has made important contributions to scientific progress in understanding the history and structure of the universe.</p>
<p>&#8226; UCSC launched a large-scale data repository&#160;and user portal for the National Cancer Institute's cancer genome research programs. Meanwhile, UCSC combined Rx with R2D2 when it <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/01/robotic-surgery.html">exported its 'open-source' robotic surgery platforms</a> to top medical research labs.</p>
<p>&#8226;&#160; UCSC alumnus <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/10/rev-fall-12-alumni-collins.html">Steve Collins of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> was seen in photographs around the world during news coverage of the dramatic landing of NASA's robotic explorer Curiosity on the surface of Mars. Collins helped guide the explorer to a successful landing on August 5.</p>
<p>&#8226; UCSC&#8217;s cutting-edge research continued to influence the world. In fact, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/10/research-influence.html">the campus ranked second in research influence</a> as measured by the number of times its faculty's published work is cited by scholars around the world.<span>&#160;</span></p>
<p><strong>A natural respect for wildlife</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#160;</strong>&#8226; A comprehensive study, led by UCSC researchers, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/06/condors-and-lead.html">confirmed that lead-based bullets are the primary source of lead in condors</a> and showed that the condor population cannot recover as long as lead contamination persists.</p>
<p>&#8226; UCSC community members <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/02/cougar-forum-draws-crowd.html">filled an auditorium on campus</a> to learn about Chris Wilmers&#8217;s <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/12/puma-project.html">Santa Cruz Mountains Puma Project</a>. Wilmers got laughs and a few relieved sighs when he remarked that Santa Cruzans have a better chance of getting hospitalized because of a run-in with their own toothbrushes than getting hurt by a mountain lion.</p>
<p>&#8226; In other creature news,&#160; a UCSC Ph.D. student looking at the spread of Lyme disease in the east <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/06/red-fox-lyme-disease.html">linked it to a decline in foxes</a> that feed on the small rodents that carry infected ticks. Previously, the carries were believed to be deer.</p>
<p>&#8226; There were also a few UCSC-related &#8216;aw&#8217; moments in the natural realm. One of them was the <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/03/peregrine-falcons.html">discovery of four Peregrine falcon eggs in a nest on the PG&amp;E headquarters building in San Francisco</a>, captivating web watchers in the spring.</p>
<p><strong>Treading lightly on the earth</strong></p>
<p>&#8226; Pioneering UCSC faculty are addressing safer and healthier ways to grow food while treading more lightly on the earth. This year the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/08/casfs-usda-grant.html">won two significant grants</a> from the U.S. Department of Agriculture totaling more than $3.25 million to expand research into <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/11/organic-farming-research.html">alternative methods of growing strawberries without pesticides</a> and to teach and support new organic farmers.&#160;</p>
<p><strong>Slugs, arts and letters</strong></p>
<p>&#8226; Slugs also recognize the value of a genuine California cultural treasure. This year UCSC had a grand celebration <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/06/dead-opening.html">to launch the Grateful Dead Archive</a>, which represents one of the most significant popular cultural collections of the 20th Century. Many media outlets took notice, including the New Yorker.</p>
<p>&#8226;&#160; Slugs also told heir own stories in a highly public and prestigious realm this year. One of them, UCSC alumna Reyna Grande, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/10/reyna-grande.html">received raves for a new memoir about immigration</a>.</p>
<p>&#8226;&#160; UCSC tapped the director of the Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery at Skidmore College to lead <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/09/weber-release.html">an innovative museum project</a>, the Institute for Arts &amp; Science. &#8220;The institute will be the first of its kind at a research university focusing on the relationship between the arts and sciences,&#8220; noted David Yager, dean of the Arts Division at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8226; This year, UC Santa Cruz professor of Film and Digital Media B. Ruby Rich <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/06/ruby-rich-frameline.html">was awarded the 2012 Frameline Award</a> at the 36th annual San Francisco International LGBT Film Festival, running June 14 to 24.</p>
<p><strong>Slugs in high places</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Banana Slugs roamed the halls of power this year.</p>
<p>&#8226; Slugs also served other very high-profile advisory roles. Psychology and legal studies professor Craig Haney, a national expert on inmate mental health, told a U.S. Senate subcommittee in June that <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/06/haney-solitary.html">solitary confinement rates have soared since the 1970s</a> and for many inmates the practice "precipitates a descent into madness."</p>
<p>&#8226; UC Santa Cruz alumna Rachel Goslins, executive director of the President&#8217;s Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/10/goslins-obama.html">serves on an advisory committee to the White House on cultural issues</a>.&#160;&#160;&#8220;I get to work with the White House, policymakers at the highest level of government, the private sector, and our Committee members &#8230; all in service of supporting the essential role of culture and the arts and humanities in our country. What's not to love?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8226; <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/01/dana-frank-expert.html">UCSC professor Dana Frank added to the national dialogue</a> about U.S. policy surrounding the new regime in Honduras <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/05/dana-frank-nation.html">by contributing a cover story to The Nation magazine</a>, as well as an op-ed to the New York Times.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8bcf5727807270465f253dfb919ac70b"><name>food-drive</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Feeding the hungry this holiday season</title><summary>There's still time to donate to the annual Second Harvest Food Drive.</summary><keywords>blumenthal, chancellor, food drive, holiday, second harvest, konopelski, lewis</keywords><start-date>1355216400000</start-date><display-name>Food Drive</display-name><path>/2012/12/food-drive</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/12/food-drive</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1355260319473</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1355260705151</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>It&#8217;s heartwarming to see students, faculty, and staff rallying this month to achieve an ambitious goal as part of <a href="http://www.thefoodbank.org/">Second Harvest Food Bank</a>'s annual holiday food drive.<br/>

New this year is a <a href="http://sab.ucsc.edu/raffle12.html">raffle</a> sponsored by the UCSC Staff Advisory Board. Buy raffle tickets, and your gift to Second Harvest will also buy you a chance to win great prizes, including an OPERS membership for one quarter, gift cards, and UCSC apparel. To find out where to buy tickets or to help sell them, call John Steele at 459-4065 or send him email at moriarti@ucsc.edu.<br/>
<br/>
All donations--cash and nonperishable food--will be happily accepted at the holiday party on December 12, and raffle tickets will be available, as well. Many students participate by donating a meal; UCSC Dining contributes the value of donated meals to Second Harvest.<br/>
<br/>
However you choose to give, remember that every penny raised goes directly to agencies and programs that provide high-quality, healthy food to the hungry in our community. Second Harvest was recently named the healthiest food bank in the country for providing the highest percentage of fresh fruits and vegetables to recipients. <br/>
<br/>
The holiday food drive is a great way to help our friends and neighbors. Thank you for doing your part.<br/>

Sobre: Dar alimentos a las personas necesitadas en esta temporada de las fiestas<br/>
<br/>
Es reconfortante ver a las y los estudiantes, profesorado y personal trabajando en este mes para alcanzar un objetivo ambicioso como parte de la campa&#241;a anual de colecta de alimentos del <a href="http://www.thefoodbank.org/">Second Harvest Food Bank</a>. <br/>
<br/>
La colecta de alimentos es una de las iniciativas mayores de nuestra comunidad, y la Universidad de California en Santa Cruz juega un papel muy importante.&#160; Este a&#241;o, el objetivo de nuestro campus es proporcionar 60.000 comidas para familias necesitadas.<br/>
<br/>
Usted puede ayudar de la manera tradicional, es decir, donando alimentos. Second Harvest Food Bank ha colocado 25 barriles rojos de recolecci&#243;n en &#225;reas de mucho tr&#225;fico en distintos lugares de nuestro campus, con el fin de recolectar donaciones de alimentos no perecederos. O bien, puede hacer una contribuci&#243;n en dinero y dejar que Second Harvest Food Bank haga las compras. Cada d&#243;lar que usted dona, alimenta a cuatro personas. Es f&#225;cil hacer una donaci&#243;n <a href="http://www.stayclassy.org/santa-cruz/events/uc-santa-cruz/e21167">en l&#237;nea</a> o bien utilizando uno de los sobres para donaciones adjuntos a los barriles de colecta del Second Harvest Food Drive de la UCSC.<br/>
<br/>
Este a&#241;o hay algo nuevo: <a href="http://sab.ucsc.edu/raffle12.html">una rifa</a> patrocinada por el Consejo Asesor del Personal de la UCSC. Compre boletos de la rifa, y su contribuci&#243;n a Second Harvest le dar&#225; tambi&#233;n la oportunidad de ganar grandes premios, incluyendo el ser miembro por un trimestre de la OPERS, tarjetas de regalo y ropa de la UCSC. Para saber d&#243;nde comprar boletos o ayudar a venderlos, llame a John Steele al 459-4065, o m&#225;ndele un mensaje por correo electr&#243;nico a moriarti@ucsc.edu. <br/>
<br/>
Todas las donaciones, en dinero o alimentos no perecederos, ser&#225;n aceptadas con gratitud en la celebraci&#243;n de las fiestas a realizarse el 12 de diciembre, y los boletos de la rifa estar&#225;n disponibles tambi&#233;n para la venta. Muchas y muchos estudiantes participan mediante la donaci&#243;n de una comida; el Comedor de la UCSC aporta el valor de las comidas donadas a Second Harvest.<br/>
<br/>
De cualquier manera que usted elija contribuir, recuerde que cada centavo recolectado va directamente a agencias y programas&#160; que proporcionan alimentos sanos y de alta calidad a las personas necesitadas en nuestra comunidad. Second Harvest fue nombrado recientemente el banco de alimentos m&#225;s saludables del pa&#237;s por proporcionar el porcentaje m&#225;s alto de frutas y verduras frescas a los destinatarios.<br/>
<br/>
La colecta de alimentos en la temporada de las fiestas es una manera muy importante de ayudar a nuestras/os amigas/os y vecinas/os. &#161;Muchas gracias por participar!<br/></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Chancellor Blumenthal, Academic Senate Chair Joe Konopelski, Staff Advisory Board Chair Ebony Lewis</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8cbf600b807270465f253dfbdbc5c1f0"><name>in-memoriam-gregory-sulger</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: Gregory Sulger</title><summary>A Lick Observatory staff member died shortly after noon on Tuesday, December 11, in a single-vehicle accident that occurred near the Mount Hamilton facility.

Hamilton facility. Gregory Sulger, a senior building maintenance worker who had worked and lived at Lick Observatory for the past two years, was 54.</p>
<p>Greg's death has deeply affected the 17 other Lick employees who work and live at the observatory. He was not only a dependable, committed worker, Greg was one of those rare individuals who seemed to like everyone he came in contact with. If you heard whistling or singing along the ridge of Mt. Hamilton, chances are you would soon discover that Greg was the source.</p>
<p>Not only would Greg go out of his way to assist visitors at the observatory, he was also a guy who would just pop his head into your office in the morning to ask how you were doing.</p>
<p>Greg left a lasting impression on the staff and visitors of Mt. Hamilton during the time he called our community home. He loved it on the mountain; he actually reveled in it. And his spirit will always be with us here.</p>
<p>Lick Observatory will hold a celebration of Greg's life on Wednesday, December 19, at 3 p.m. in the observatory's Main Building. For updated information, please go to:&#160;<a href="http://www.ucolick.org">ucolick.org</a>.</p>

<p>Initially hired as a clerk typist in 1966, Ruth Crook concluded her career on campus in 1992; later in her career, she served as executive assistant to then-vice chancellor Wendell Brase.</p>
<p>Crook returned to visit the campus in November 2010, when she was among the guests at a University House luncheon hosted by Chancellor Blumenthal. The luncheon honored about a dozen "pioneer" staff and faculty members, many of whom were working on the campus in the inaugural year of 1965-66 (<a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2010/12/founders-luncheon.html">see story</a>).</p>

<br/>
 Without you, none of what we do every day at our campuses and medical centers would be possible.<br/>
<br/>
 Every year, we educate 230,000 students at our campuses, nurturing some of the brightest young minds in our state. Our medical centers heal thousands and serve as a vital safety net for the uninsured and underinsured. Our researchers drive innovation, from developing new treatments for brain cancer to building a smarter, greener electric grid to cut greenhouse gas emissions.<br/>
<br/>
 That kind of commitment to the public good and pioneering ingenuity is something we can all be proud of.<br/>
<br/>
 To be sure, we had some significant challenges this year. We continued to grapple with how to preserve UC&#8217;s access, affordability and excellence against a backdrop of constrained state funding and rising health care and other costs. Demand for a UC education continued to climb &#8212; both a testament to UC&#8217;s quality and value and a challenge to our commitment to serve California.<br/>
<br/>
 In one of the bright spots this year, Californians demonstrated the value they place on public higher education and their faith in this University by approving Proposition 30, helping to avert a $250 million mid-year state budget cut that would have meant double-digit tuition increases. At the same time, we know Prop. 30 is both a partial and temporary solution. We must continue to explore other ideas to protect the quality and financial future of the University, and I remain committed to doing just that.<br/>
<br/>
 Already one of our newer initiatives, Project You Can, has raised $501 million for student scholarships and fellowships and is on track to hit its $1 billion target by 2014. And the Working Smarter initiative has produced more than $289 million in administrative efficiencies in its first two years, as part of a goal to achieve a positive fiscal impact of $500 million over five years.<br/>
<br/>
 Despite the difficult economic backdrop, you, our faculty and staff, continue to do tremendous work and make life-changing discoveries. Your commitment to improving our communities inspires me every day and makes me proud to work beside you.<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you for all you do for the University, and best wishes for a happy holiday season.<br/>
<br/>
 With best wishes I am, sincerely yours,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Mark G. Yudof<br/>

The new UC Learning Center is a Learning Management System (LMS) that provides campus units the ability to easily access, track, and manage training needs and the resources required for delivery.<br/>
</span></p>
<p><span>The system is highly configurable and anyone who is seeking training or managing the training of staff will appreciate its functionality around enrollment, notifications, reminders, certifications, and reporting. The application includes both instructor-led (classroom) training and online training, and it enables managers to easily monitor and report on training for their direct reports.</span></p>
<p><span>Approximately 123 courses have been placed into the system thus far. Many of these are compliance related courses but we have also added several of our regular campus course offerings and other trainings at the request of clients.</span></p>
<p><span>All employees can visit <a href="http://learningcenter.ucsc.edu" target="_blank">http://learningcenter.ucsc.edu</a> to log on and explore the site by using their CruzID and Gold password. In fact, if you have completed the <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/training/compliance_briefings/general.html" target="_blank">UC Ethical Values &amp; Conduct General Compliance Briefing</a>, congratulations, you have already used the system.<br/>
</span></p>
<p><span>We intend to use the system to the breadth of its ability. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:learningcenter@ucsc.edu" target="_blank">learningcenter@ucsc.edu</a> if your organization has a training that you would like to add to the LMS or if you would like a group demonstration. We will manage requests on a first come&#8211;first served basis, although compliance requirements, urgency, and timeliness of the project will be taken into consideration as needed.</span></p>

<br/>
I hope that this message finds you all well and that everyone is winding down as finals are well, finally ending. My name is Victor Velasco and I serve as the External Vice Chair under the Student Union Assembly, the campus wide undergraduate student government. I want to initiate this email by first saying how proud I am of UC Santa Cruz for its efforts to register students to vote in this election year. It has been over a month since we came out to the polls to demonstrate our electoral power as students and as a movement. Students, administration, faculty, and staff came together in solidarity to ensure that students were registered, educated on the issues that impact all Californians, and voted on November 6th. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to your participation, I am excited to announce that the Office of External Affairs was able to register over 4,000 students to vote in this election year! Working in coalition, we set a new record for the SUA and UC Santa Cruz! In addition, the University of California Student Association worked with CalPirg this year to successfully register about 51,846 students to vote, crushing our past record of 42,890 registered students in 2008. And contrary to popular belief that students wouldn't come out to vote this election year, we not only voted, but came out to the polls in higher numbers than in 2008! These are amazing victories for our movement. Students proved that if we organize ourselves, and are passionate about a cause, then we can break boundaries beyond belief. <br/>
<br/>
As we enter a new year I want to challenge all of us to continue to be politically engaged in the issues that impact everyone. Just because election season is over does not mean that the action stops. Christmas break grants us the opportunity to talk to our friends, family, and community about the issues that are most important to us. Action doesn't always have to be defined as marching or protesting at a rally to create change, it can be something as simple as sitting down with your parents and talking about why it was important for Proposition 30 to pass. Social change happens through different avenues and having a direct face to face conversation with someone is one way that change begins to progress. Utilize this break to learn more about the problems that students are facing on a local, statewide, and national level. Students are currently facing so many barriers when it comes to higher education, at the same time, it's a very exciting time to be a part of the student movement. I encourage everyone to get involved this upcoming year in any capacity that you can. This upcoming quarter the Office of External Affairs, along with the Student Union Assembly, will be offering a series of different opportunities for you to become a student advocate for public education! I hope that you all have a great Christmas Break and I look forward to the things that we will accomplish in 2013! <br/>

<p>Dine and Haber, who are being honored on the occasion of their 60th birthdays, are both well known for their contributions to the field of theoretical high-energy physics. The symposium, "The Search for Fundamental Physics: Higgs Bosons and Supersymmetry," will take place January 4 to 6, 2013.</p>
<p>"We have managed to put together a really stellar list of speakers for this symposium, and that's because of the reputations of these guys. People want to come and celebrate their careers," said Thomas Banks, professor of physics at UC Santa Cruz, who helped organize the conference.</p>
<p>The symposium comes in the aftermath of exciting developments in high-energy physics at the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland, where scientists <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/07/higgs-boson.html">announced in July</a> the discovery of the first solid evidence for the long-sought Higgs boson, a manifestation of the Higgs field thought to give mass to fundamental particles. Haber is particularly well known for his role in developing theories and the attendant phenomenology of the Higgs boson ("phenomenology" involves the application of theory to experiments in high-energy particle physics). Haber coauthored the definitive book on searching for the Higgs boson, <em>The Higgs Hunter's Guide,</em> published in 1989. A fellow of the American Physical Society, Haber received a prestigious Humboldt Research Award in 2009.</p>
<p>"A lot of his work in theoretical physics has emphasized experimental discovery and provides guidelines to the experimentalists in their efforts to discover new things," Banks said. "He is considered a great expert on both the Higgs boson and the search for supersymmetry."</p>
<p>Supersymmetry is a hypothetical symmetry in particle physics that is mathematically elegant but, for now, has very little evidence to support it. Its theoretical properties could help solve certain problems with the Standard Model of particle physics.</p>
<p>Dine has worked on some of the same phenomenological subjects as Haber, including the Higgs boson and supersymmetry. He has also done more theoretical work, making&#160;fundamental contributions to superstring theory and quantum field theory. He is the author, with Ian Affleck, of the Affleck-Dine mechanism to explain the asymmetry between matter and anti-matter in the universe. Dine is also known for his theoretical work on a hypothetical particle called the axion, which may account for the mysterious dark matter in the universe.</p>
<p>"Michael has done such an enormous number of things in mathematical and theoretical physics that he's one of the most highly respected people in our field," Banks said.</p>
<p>Dine is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Physical Society. The Division of Physical and Biological Sciences at UCSC honored him with its 2010-11 Outstanding Faculty Award.&#160;</p>
<p>Speakers at the symposium will include Nobel laureate David Gross, former director and permanent member of the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at UC Santa Barbara; Nathan Seiberg and Edward Witten from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.; and Leonard Susskind of Stanford University.</p>

A new project funded by a $3.5 million grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) aims to develop human-robot collaborative systems for jobs that are hard for people, but can't be done by autonomous robots alone.</p>
<p>A primary goal of the project is to advance the state of robotic surgery, which is currently limited in many cases to one robotic system controlled by a single surgeon. Jacob Rosen, a medical robotics expert at UC Santa Cruz and co-principal investigator in the project, said human-robot collaborative systems could have a wide range of industrial applications as well.</p>
<p>"Algorithms developed for surgery can be generalized for applications in industry, and industry applications might be easier targets because surgery is such a complex task," said Rosen, a professor of computer engineering in the <a href="http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a> at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The project takes advantage of the open-source <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/01/robotic-surgery.html">Raven II robotic surgery platform</a>, which the Bionics Lab at UCSC, led by Rosen, developed with researchers at the University of Washington (UW). With funding from an earlier NSF grant, they built seven copies of the Raven II for distribution to top medical research labs. Several of those labs--at UW, Johns Hopkins University, and UC Berkeley--are involved in the new project. A new Raven II system will be built for lead investigator Allison Okamura's lab at Stanford University.</p>
<p>Surgery historically has been a collaborative effort involving two or more surgeons and assistants working together. "Surgery is such a demanding task, both from a motor-control perspective and in the decision-making required, that it is very difficult for a single individual to conduct," Rosen said. "With robotic surgery, however, this collaborative model has been interrupted, because the surgical robot is a single entity controlled by a single surgeon. This project is all about regaining the collaboration that surgeons used to do, given the presence of surgical robots in the operating room."&#160;</p>
<p>Different modes of collaboration are possible, such as two robotic devices controlled by two surgeons, or one system controlled by a surgeon and another functioning autonomously. Certain surgical tasks that require repetitive motions, such as suturing, dissection, or retraction, might be fully or partly automated. "People are very good at decision-making, but they get tired easily by doing repetitive tasks. So one goal is to move people back to a decision-making role instead of doing the tedious processes that can potentially be automated," Rosen said.</p>
<p>The project will approach this problem not only at the robot level, but also by developing a higher-level framework for analyzing the whole process, including the roles and interactions of both humans and robots. "Our research suggests that surgery is like a language," Rosen said. "The words of this language are defined by various types of tissue interactions, and the pronunciation of the words relates to the magnitudes of the forces, torques, and velocities applied to the tissues. Understanding and characterizing the grammar of the surgical language will allow us to deconstruct surgical tasks into their fundamental elements and, to some extent, automate them."</p>
<p>In working to develop a new framework for human-robot collaboration, the project will focus on two real-world applications. One is robot-assisted surgery with two robotic devices involved in the same procedure, such as complex suturing procedures. The other is a manufacturing process involving the wiring harnesses for aircraft, in which a specific tying operation is repeated hundreds of times.</p>
<p>In both the manufacturing and medical procedures, the researchers will seek to enhance communication between the human and robot partners. "It's hard to get robots and people to work together, and it's even harder to get multiple people and multiple robots to work together," said Okamura. "A main focus of our project is to get robots to try to understand what people are doing and be able to step in when necessary."</p>
<p>Rosen noted that the robotics researchers have gained a lot of appreciation for surgeons and for the complexity and demanding nature of the work they do. "We are very humble in our attempts to progress the state of the art, improve outcomes, and contribute to human health," he said.</p>
<p>Along with Rosen and Okamura, the co-investigators on the project are Blake Hannaford at UW; Pieter Abbeel and Ken Goldberg at UC Berkeley; and Gregory Hager at Johns Hopkins University.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://bionics.soe.ucsc.edu/index.html</url><title>Bionics Lab at UC Santa Cruz</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="aa2123d38072704656893e39952f5198"><name>photo-contest-favorites</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>2012 Photo Contest</title><summary>We received over 200 entries to this year's Chancellor's Holiday Photo Contest.

An award-winning game designer, Romero is co-founder and chief operating officer of <a href="http://lootdrop.com/">Loot Drop</a>, Inc., where she plans to continue working on game titles currently in development.</p>
<p>The new Game Designer in Residence program brings a leading game designer to UCSC to teach courses and serve as an adviser and resource for game design students, faculty, and researchers on campus. The one-year, 80-percent appointment includes teaching foundational courses in game design, giving students an unequaled opportunity to learn directly from an expert practitioner. Romero's appointment starts January 1, 2013.</p>
<p>"It is tremendously exciting to have Brenda Romero as UCSC's first game designer in residence," said Jim Whitehead, professor and chair of computer science in the <a href="http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a>. "She brings to the position over 30 years of experience in game design and an extensive understanding of the business of games, and she is an innovator in the teaching of game design. It's huge that our students will have the opportunity to learn directly from her."</p>
<p>Romero will also pursue independent works and explore new ideas in game design. "It's amazing a position like 'game designer in residence' exists," she said. "To have an opportunity to work on designs with students and without constraints allows me to explore some designs that I've not yet been able to explore. My husband [game designer John Romero] and I have been to UCSC numerous times, and its dual focus on design and coding gives everyone a much stronger possibility space to draw from."</p>
<p>The game designer in residence is supported by the Center for Games and Playable Media and will participate in giving design feedback and guidance on several ongoing research projects at the center.</p>
<p>"Brenda's deep expertise in game design as an aesthetic practice enhances our mission at the Center for Games and Playable Media," said center director Michael Mateas, professor of computer science. "Here, we strive to blend excellence in art with technical innovation. Her participation in future research projects will help us explore fundamentally new gameplay possibilities."</p>

<p>At a distance of twelve light years from Earth and visible to the naked eye in the evening sky, Tau Ceti is the closest single star that has the same spectral classification as our Sun. Its five planets are estimated to have masses between two and six times the mass of the Earth, making it the lowest-mass planetary system yet detected. One of the planets lies in the habitable zone of the star and has a mass around five times that of Earth, making it the smallest planet found to be orbiting in the habitable zone of any Sun-like star.</p>
<p>The international team of astronomers from the United Kingdom, Chile, United States, and Australia, combined more than six-thousand observations from three different instruments and intensively modeled the data. Using new techniques, the team has found a method to detect signals half the size previously thought possible. This greatly improves the sensitivity of searches for small planets and suggests that Tau Ceti is not a lone star but has a planetary system. The team presented its findings in a paper that has been accepted for publication in <em>Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics.</em></p>
<p>"This discovery is in keeping with our emerging view that virtually every star has planets, and that the galaxy must have many such potentially habitable Earth-sized planets," said coauthor Steve Vogt, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz. "We are now beginning to understand that nature seems to overwhelmingly prefer systems that have multiple planets with orbits of less than 100 days. This is quite unlike our own solar system, where there is nothing with an orbit inside that of Mercury. So our solar system is, in some sense, a bit of a freak and not the most typical kind of system that Nature cooks up."</p>
<p>First author Mikko Tuomi of the University of Hertfordshire emphasized the importance of new techniques the team developed. "We pioneered new data modeling techniques by adding artificial signals to the data and testing our recovery of the signals with a variety of different approaches," Tuomi said. "This significantly improved our noise modeling techniques and increased our ability to find low-mass planets."</p>
<p>Hugh Jones, also at the University of Hertfordshire, said the researchers chose Tau Ceti for this noise-modeling study because they had thought it contained no signals. "As it is so bright and similar to our Sun, it is an ideal benchmark system to test out our methods for the detection of small planets," Jones said.</p>
<p>Over 800 planets have been discovered orbiting other worlds, but planets in orbit around the nearest Sun-like stars are particularly valuable. "Tau Ceti is one of our nearest cosmic neighbors and so bright that we may be able to study the atmospheres of these planets in the not-too-distant future. Planetary systems found around nearby stars close to our Sun indicate that these systems are common in our Milky Way galaxy," said James Jenkins of Universidad de Chile, a visiting fellow at the University of Hertfordshire.</p>
<p>The researchers discovered this planetary system using data from three state-of-the-art spectrographs: HARPS on the 3.6-meter telescope at the European Southern Observatory in La Silla, Chile (4864 data points); UCLES on the Anglo-Australian Telescope in Siding Spring, Australia (978 data points); and HIRES on the 10-meter Keck telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii (567 data points).</p>
<p>The result is based on spectra from taken as part of the Anglo-Australian Planet Search with the UCLES spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope, HIRES on the Keck Telescope, and reanalysis of spectra taken with the HARPS spectrograph and available through the European Southern Observatory public archive. This work would have not been possible without the ESO public data policies and the excellent work of the ESO Software development division and the ESO Science Archive Facility.</p>
<p>The international research team consists of Mikko Tuomi, Hugh Jones, John Barnes and David Pinfield (University of Hertfordshire); James Jenkins (University of Chile and University of Hertfordshire); Chris Tinney, Rob Wittenmyer, Jonathan Horner, Jeremy Bailey, Duncan Wright and Graeme Salter (University of New South Wales, Australia); Steve Vogt (UC Santa Cruz); Paul Butler (Carnegie Institution for Science); Simon O'Toole (Australian Astronomical Observatory); and Brad Carter (University of Southern Queensland).</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="affe6c808072704633c346d7b6dbd74f"><name>factor-leave-accrual</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Factor Leave Accrual and Change in Work Week</title><summary>Beginning January 1, 2013, all non-academic UCSC Staff and Student Employees will begin accruing leave based on a Factor Leave Accrual Table, rather than on a Monthly Leave Accrual Table.&#13;

<br/>
 Factor leave accrual means that sick and vacation leave accruals are calculated based on a factor accrual rate. The factor accrual rates can be found on the</span> <span><a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/forms/shr-2043.pdf" target="_blank">Factor Leave Table</a> and vary based on appointment accrual rate codes and leave type.<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>For example:</strong></span> <span><br/>
<br/>
 A full time employee with a leave code of <strong>A</strong> per policy may accrue up to 120 vacation hours annually, based on full-time hours on pay status. The factor leave accrual rate is determined by dividing 120 hours by total annual working hours, and rounding up to the fourth decimal place. This results in a vacation accrual factor of .0577 for employees with Leave Accrual Code <strong>A</strong>. The leave accrued in a given leave accrual period is then determined by the actual number of hours on pay status in that leave accrual period multiplied by the leave accrual factor rate.<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>Important to note:</strong></span> <span><br/>
</span> 
<ul>
<li><span>Annualized accruals will not change.</span></li>
<li><span>For monthly paid employees, accruals will be based on hours on pay status in the calendar month; the maximum possible monthly accrual will vary month to month, along with total monthly working hours.</span></li>
<li><span>For biweekly paid employees, accruals will be based on hours on pay status in a <a href="http://biweeklypay.ucsc.edu/time-attendance/factor-leave/quadriweekly.html" target="_blank">quadriweekly cycle</a> [four week period]&#8211;this means that the vacation/sick accruals are always based on a maximum of 160 hours per leave accrual period.</span></li>
<li><span>Accruals will continue to be available for use after the end of of the leave accrual period. Leave accrual period end dates can be found on the <a href="https://financial.ucsc.edu/SiteCollectionDocuments/Calendar_Year_Pay_Dates_2013.pdf">payroll calendar</a>.</span></li>
<li><span>Academic employees will continue accruing leave based on the monthly accrual table.<br/>
</span></li>
</ul>
 <span>Also effective in January 2013, the official work week for UC Santa Cruz will change to Sunday through Saturday. CruzPay users will notice this change on their timesheets in January.<br/>
<br/>
 Both changes are UC system-wide standardizations driven by the</span> <span><a href="http://ucpath.ucsc.edu/" target="_blank">UCPath Project</a>.<br/>

 Sobre: Factor para la Acumulaci&#243;n de Licencia y Cambio en la Semana de Trabajo</span> <span><br/>
<br/>
 A partir del primero de enero de 2013, todas las empleadas no acad&#233;micas y todos los empleados no acad&#233;micos del Personal y estudiantes que son empleadas y empleados de la UCSC comenzar&#225;n a acumular la licencia sobre la base de una Tabla de Factor para la Acumulaci&#243;n de Licencia, en lugar de sobre una Tabla Mensual de Acumulaci&#243;n de Licencia.</span> <span><br/>
<br/>
 Factor para la acumulaci&#243;n de licencia significa que las acumulaciones de licencia por enfermedad y de vacaciones son calculadas sobre la base de una tasa de factor de acumulaci&#243;n. Las tasas &#160;de factor de acumulaci&#243;n pueden ser vistas en el enlace de la Tabla de Factor de Licencia (</span> <span><a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/forms/shr-2043.pdf" target="_blank">Factor Leave Table</a>) y var&#237;an sobre la base de los c&#243;digos de tasa de acumulaci&#243;n seg&#250;n el nombramiento y el tipo de licencia.<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>Por ejemplo:</strong></span> <span><br/>
<br/>
 Una empleada o un empleado de tiempo completo con un c&#243;digo de licencia de <strong>A</strong> por p&#243;liza puede acumular hasta 120 horas de vacaciones anualmente, basadas sobre horas de tiempo completo en status de pago. La tasa de factor de acumulaci&#243;n de licencia es determinada dividiendo 120 horas por el total de las horas anuales de trabajo, y redonde&#225;ndola a la cuarta posici&#243;n decimal. Esto resulta en un factor de acumulaci&#243;n de vacaciones del .0577 para las empleadas y los empleados con el C&#243;digo <strong>A</strong> de Acumulaci&#243;n de Licencia. La licencia acumulada &#160;en un per&#237;odo dado de acumulaci&#243;n de licencia es determinada entonces por el n&#250;mero real de horas en status de pago en ese per&#237;odo de acumulaci&#243;n de licencia multiplicado por la tasa de factor de acumulaci&#243;n de licencia.<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>Importante se&#241;alar:</strong></span> <span><br/>
<br/>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; . &#160; &#160; Las acumulaciones anualizadas (o anuales) no van a cambiar.<br/>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; . &#160; &#160; Para las empleadas y los empleados que reciben un pago mensual, las<br/>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; acumulaciones ser&#225;n basadas sobre horas en status de pago en el mes<br/>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; calendario; la m&#225;xima acumulaci&#243;n mensual posible va a variar de mes a<br/>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; mes, junto con el total de las horas mensuales trabajadas.<br/>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; . &#160; &#160; Para las empleadas y los empleados que reciben un pago quincenal, las<br/>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; acumulaciones ser&#225;n determinadas sobre horas en status de pago en un<br/>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; ciclo de cuatro semanas, &#8220;<a href="http://biweeklypay.ucsc.edu/time-attendance/factor-leave/quadriweekly.html" target="_blank">quadriweekly cycle</a>&#8221; (per&#237;odo de cuatro semanas).<br/>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Esto significa que las acumulaciones por vacaciones/enfermedad siempre<br/>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; son basadas sobre un m&#225;ximo de 160 horas por per&#237;odo de acumulaci&#243;n de<br/>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; licencia.<br/>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; . &#160; &#160; Las acumulaciones continuar&#225;n siendo disponibles para el uso despu&#233;s del<br/>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; fin del per&#237;odo de acumulaci&#243;n de licencia. Las fechas de terminaci&#243;n del<br/>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; per&#237;odo de acumulaci&#243;n de licencia &#160;pueden ser vistas en el calendario de<br/>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; sueldos, <a href="https://financial.ucsc.edu/SiteCollectionDocuments/Calendar_Year_Pay_Dates_2013.pdf">payroll calendar</a>.<br/>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; . &#160; &#160; Las empleadas acad&#233;micas y los empleados acad&#233;micos continuar&#225;n<br/>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; acumulando licencia sobre la base de la tabla de acumulaci&#243;n mensual.<br/>
<br/>

For me, the drive to move UCSC forward is rooted in a desire to provide opportunity to the next generation. Some call it "giving back." I think of it as investing in the future.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
As a product of public higher education, I know firsthand the impact that accessible, affordable, quality education makes in the lives of high school graduates. Thousands of high school seniors have just applied to UC Santa Cruz. They are hard-working and talented, and we as a campus are committed to helping them realize their ambitions.<br/>
<br/>
For nearly 50 years, UC Santa Cruz has provided a platform on which students build their futures. The campus's impact has been shaped in part by strong campus values of social justice and environmental stewardship, and by students themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Just a few years ago, a handful of students were interested in conserving energy, reducing waste, and saving water&#8212;this was before the term "sustainability" became a household word. Those students led the way for the campus, joined by staff, faculty, and administrators who responded enthusiastically to their vision. Today, UCSC's sustainability program is a vital part of this institution.<br/>
<br/>
That's just one example of a student-led initiative that has become integral to who we are and what we do. Minority outreach programs are another example of student-to-student action that has enormous impact. Each spring, members of three student organizations&#8212;Destination Higher Education, A Step Forward, and Oportunidades Rumbo A La Educaci&#243;n--reach out to high school seniors from underrepresented groups who are considering enrolling at UCSC. Our students invite them to campus, host them overnight, and introduce them to college life. Not surprisingly, this personal approach makes a big difference; by the end of their visit, an impressive number of these prospective students are eager to enroll.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of each year, when short days and long nights invite reflection, I ponder our collective impact and feel great pride. Banana Slugs--students, faculty, staff, and alumni--share a vision of a better, more just world. Enjoy the break, and I hope you return to campus in January feeling refreshed and ready for another busy quarter. Happy Holidays!</p>

Para: la comunidad de la Universidad de California en Santa Cruz<br/>
De parte de: Chancellor Blumenthal<br/>
Sobre: Reflexiones sobre la importancia de nuestra misi&#243;n<br/>
<br/>
Mientras terminamos el trimestre y nos preparamos para dar paso a un nuevo a&#241;o, me encuentro reflexionando sobre el valor de lo que hacemos en la Universidad de California en Santa Cruz. Para m&#237;, el impulso de hacer progresar a la UCSC tiene su origen en el deseo de ofrecer oportunidades a la generaci&#243;n venidera. Algunas y algunos lo llaman &#8220;devolver&#8221;. Por mi parte, pienso que es una inversi&#243;n en el futuro.<br/>
<br/>
Siendo producto de la educaci&#243;n superior p&#250;blica, s&#233; de primera mano el impacto que la educaci&#243;n accesible, asequible y de calidad tiene en la vida de las graduadas y los graduados de secundaria. Miles de estudiantes del &#250;ltimo a&#241;o de secundaria acaban de aplicar a la UCSC. Son muy trabajadoras/es y con talento, y en nuestro campus estamos comprometidas y comprometidos a ayudarlas/os a hacer realidad sus aspiraciones.<br/>
<br/>
Durante casi 50 a&#241;os, la Universidad de California en Santa Cruz ha proporcionado una plataforma en la que las y los estudiantes pueden construir su futuro. El impacto del campus ha sido formado en parte por los fuertes valores de justicia social y cuidado del medio ambiente que orientan a nuestra escuela, y por las/os mismas/os estudiantes.<br/>
<br/>
Hace apenas unos a&#241;os, un grupo de estudiantes estaba interesado en la conservaci&#243;n de energ&#237;a, en la reducci&#243;n de residuos y en el ahorro del agua &#8211;y esto fue antes de que el t&#233;rmino &#8220;sustentabilidad&#8221; se convirtiera en una palabra familiar. Esas y esos estudiantes abrieron el camino en nuestro campus, junto con la participaci&#243;n del personal, profesorado y administradoras/es que respondieron con entusiasmo a su visi&#243;n. Hoy en d&#237;a, el programa de sustentabilidad de la UCSC es parte vital de esta instituci&#243;n.<br/>
<br/>
Este es s&#243;lo un ejemplo de una iniciativa liderada por estudiantes que se ha convertido en parte integral de lo que somos y lo que hacemos. Los programas de extensi&#243;n a minor&#237;as son otro ejemplo de acci&#243;n de estudiante a estudiante que tiene un impacto enorme. Cada primavera, miembros de tres organizaciones estudiantiles: Destino Educaci&#243;n Superior (Destination Higher Education), Un Paso Adelante (A Step Forward) y Oportunidades Rumbo a la Educaci&#243;n, se ponen en contacto con estudiantes de grupos subrepresentados, del &#250;ltimo a&#241;o de secundaria, que est&#225;n considerando inscribirse en la UCSC. Nuestras y nuestros estudiantes las/los invitan al campus, hospedan e introducen a la vida universitaria. No es sorprendente que este enfoque personal signifique una gran diferencia: al final de la visita, un n&#250;mero impresionante de estas/os posibles estudiantes est&#225;n ansiosas/os por inscribirse.<br/>
<br/>
Al final de cada a&#241;o, cuando los d&#237;as cortos y las noches largas invitan a la reflexi&#243;n, considero y pienso en nuestro impacto colectivo y siento un gran orgullo. Banana Slugs &#8211;estudiantes, profesorado, personal y ex-alumnas/os &#8211; comparten la visi&#243;n de un mundo mejor y m&#225;s justo. Disfruten del descanso, y espero que regresen al campus en enero sinti&#233;ndose renovadas/os y listas/os para otro trimestre de mucha actividad. &#161;Felices Fiestas!<br/>

(Photo by Elena Zhukova)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The White House announced today that a UC Santa Cruz faculty member is one of a dozen researchers selected by President Obama to receive the National Medal of Science. Sandra Faber, a University Professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC and the interim director of UC Observatories, will receive the award from the president at a White House ceremony in early 2013.</p>
<p>In addition to selecting 12 recipients of the Medal of Science, President Obama also named 11 recipients of the National Medal of Technology and Innovation. The two awards are considered the highest honors bestowed by the United States government upon scientists, engineers, and inventors.</p>
<p>"I am proud to honor these inspiring American innovators," President Obama said. "They represent the ingenuity and imagination that has long made this nation great &#8212; and they remind us of the enormous impact a few good ideas can have when these creative qualities are unleashed in an entrepreneurial environment."</p>
<p>An award-winning observational astronomer with research interests in cosmology and galaxy formation, Faber has made important contributions to scientific progress in understanding the history and structure of the universe.</p>
<p>She has coauthored nearly 250 scientific papers, and her work has been cited over 37,000 times. A member of the National Academy of Sciences, American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and American Philosophical Society, Faber has received many awards and honors for her achievements. These include the Franklin Institute's 2009 Bower Award and Prize for Achievement in Science and two awards in 2012 for lifetime scientific achievement, the Bruce Medal of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific and the Russell Prize of the American Astronomical Society.</p>
<p>Faber currently leads the CANDELS project, the largest project in the history of the Hubble Space Telescope, to extend our view of galaxy formation back nearly to the Big Bang.</p>
<p>"In her years at UC Santa Cruz, Sandy has amassed an amazing record of scientific achievement, innovation, and excellence in teaching," UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal said. "I am absolutely delighted that she has been selected to receive the National Medal of Science, an honor that Sandy richly deserves."</p>
<p>The National Medal of Science was created by statute in 1959 and is administered for the White House by the National Science Foundation. Awarded annually, the medal recognizes individuals who have made outstanding contributions to science and engineering. A committee of Presidential appointees selects nominees on the basis of their extraordinary knowledge in and contributions to chemistry, engineering, computing, mathematics, or the biological, behavioral/social, and physical sciences.</p>
<p>"Receiving the National Medal of Science is the thrill of&#160;a lifetime, but good science does not happen in isolation," Faber said upon learning of her selection. "Let me take this moment to express my gratitude to the University of California Observatories&#160;and UC Santa Cruz for providing both world-class telescopes and superb&#160;collaborators, without which the discoveries I've made would never have happened."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/12/21/president-obama-honors-nation-s-top-scientists-and-innovators-0</url><title>White House press release announcing National Medal of Honor recipients</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.astro.ucsc.edu/faculty/profiles/singleton.php?&amp;singleton=true&amp;cruz_id=smfaber</url><title>Professor Faber's departmental home page</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bf4d2099807270465c2d638b35bd35a7"><name>hr-avc-visits</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Candidate Finalists’ On-Campus Visits for Assistant Vice Chancellor, Staff Human Resources</title><summary>The national recruitment and search for the position of Assistant Vice Chancellor (AVC) for Staff Human Resources (SHR) has yielded four candidate finalists who will be visiting campus at the beginning of the winter quarter. </summary><start-date>1356080400000</start-date><display-name>Candidate Finalists’ On-Campus Visits for Assistant Vice Chancellor, Staff Human Resources</display-name><path>/2012/12/hr-avc-visits</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/12/hr-avc-visits</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1356124201059</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1356124230310</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Staff</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span>On behalf of Sarah Latham, Vice Chancellor Business and Administrative Services (BAS), I am pleased to announce that the national recruitment and search for the position of Assistant Vice Chancellor (AVC) for Staff Human Resources (SHR) has yielded four candidate finalists who will be visiting campus at the beginning of the winter quarter.
