If scientists can identify the genetic changes that drive each patient's cancer cells, they can use that information to develop targeted treatments. But achieving this goal will require massive amounts of genomic and clinical data and a sophisticated infrastructure to manage and analyze the data.</p>
<p>The University of California, Santa Cruz, has now completed a first step in building this infrastructure, said UC Santa Cruz bioinformatics expert David Haussler. Haussler's team has established the Cancer Genomics Hub (CGHub), a large-scale data repository and user portal for the National Cancer Institute's cancer genome research programs. CGHub's initial "beta" release is providing cancer researchers with efficient access to a large and rapidly growing store of valuable biomedical data. The project is funded by the <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/">National Cancer Institute</a> (NCI) through a $10.3 million subcontract with SAIC-Frederick Inc., the prime contractor for the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research.</p>

<div class="prCaption">Bioinformatics expert David Haussler and clinical oncologist Christopher Benz discuss the role of genomics in the development of personalized cancer care.</div>
</div>
<p>In personalized care, doctors design treatments to target specific genetic changes found in a patient's cancer cells. Researchers are trying to catalog all the genetic abnormalities found in different types of cancers and find connections between specific genetic changes and how patients respond to different treatments. The scale and complexity of the information being gathered creates a critical challenge in the area of data management.</p>
<p>Although recent studies using genetically targeted treatments have shown promising results, much more research is needed to enable their widespread use, Haussler said. "There won't be one magic bullet, because cancer is not one disease, or even 100 diseases. Every instance of cancer is different. We have to improve our understanding of the molecular biology of cancer and develop computer algorithms so that we can analyze the genetic changes in each individual patient. It will take time. But with cancer genomics, we will eventually know our enemy completely."</p>

<h3>27 Years of Leadership</h3>
<p>See a <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/features/genomics/milestones.html">timeline</a> of genomics research at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
</div>
<p>Haussler's team assembled the first draft of the human genome sequence in 2000 and created and maintains the <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu">UCSC Genome Browser</a>, a web-based tool that is used extensively in biomedical research and serves as the platform for several large-scale genomics projects. His group's contributions to cancer genomics research include creation of a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2009/03/2802.html">Cancer Genomics Browser</a> for analyzing data from large-scale cancer studies.</p>
<p>Haussler's group built CGHub to support all three major NCI cancer genome sequencing programs: The Cancer Genome Atlas (<a href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov/">TCGA</a>), Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (<a href="http://target.cancer.gov/">TARGET</a>), and the Cancer Genome Characterization Initiative (<a href="http://cgap.nci.nih.gov/cgci.html">CGCI</a>). TCGA is a collaborative effort led by NCI and the National Human Genome Research Institute to map the genomic changes that occur in at least 20 major types and subtypes of adult cancer. The TARGET program is a related effort focusing on the five most common childhood cancers, and the CGCI makes available genomic data from HIV-associated cancers and certain lymphoid and childhood cancers.</p>
<p>These programs are laying the foundation for personalized cancer care by creating a database that scientists around the world can use to connect specific genomic changes with clinical outcomes. Haussler's group has been closely involved in data analysis for TCGA.</p>
<p>"TCGA is allowing us for the first time to look at cancer in full molecular detail," Haussler said. "Cancer is a disease caused by disruption of DNA molecules within the cell. When life starts, every cell in the body has the same DNA. In the course of a person's lifetime, however, some cells may accumulate changes in their DNA that cause them to go rogue and multiply without control, creating the disease we call cancer. For the first time now, we are able to look into an individual patient's cancer cells and see all the genetic disruptions, among which are the molecular drivers of that person's cancer."</p>
<p>There are currently only a few situations in which doctors can prescribe a treatment plan based on the specific genetic mutations in a patient's cancer cells. That is expected to change as projects like TCGA, TARGET, and CGCI yield a comprehensive catalog that researchers can use to find new targets for medicines and discover clues to improve patient outcomes. But there is an urgent need for an efficient and user-friendly portal to give researchers access to the data. The NCI genome projects are producing staggering amounts of data.</p>
<p>"The scale of this is far beyond anything faced in medical research before," Haussler said. "Each genome file, the DNA record from a tumor or normal tissue, is 300 billion bytes. And for every case there are two of these files, the cancer genome and the normal genome. Add to this RNA sequence data, and the prospect of deeper sequencing in the future, and we must plan for up to a terabyte (1,000 billion bytes) for each case."</p>
<p>TCGA currently generates about 10 terabytes of data each month. For comparison, the Hubble Space Telescope amassed about 45 terabytes of data in its first 20 years of operation. TCGA's output will increase tenfold or more over the next two years. Over the next four years, if the project produces a terabyte of DNA and RNA data from each of more than 10,000 patients, it will have produced 10 petabytes of data (a petabyte is 1,000 terabytes). And TCGA is just the beginning of the data deluge, Haussler said, noting that 10,000 cases is a small fraction of the 1.5 million new cancer cases diagnosed every year in the United States alone.&#160;</p>
<p>New data compression schemes are expected to reduce the total storage space needed, so the CGHub repository is designed initially to hold 5 petabytes and to allow further growth as needed. That is still a massive amount of data, and CGHub will need to accommodate transfers of extremely large data files.</p>
<p>Managed by the UCSC team, the CGHub computer system is located at the San Diego Supercomputer Center. It is connected by high-performance national research networks to major centers nationwide that are participating in these projects, including UCSC. Haussler's team designed and oversees the storage and computing infrastructure for the repository, which has an automated query and download interface for large-scale, high-speed use. It will eventually also include an interactive web-based interface to allow researchers to browse and query the system and download custom datasets.</p>
<p>It may take years for cancer genomics research to bring about major changes in cancer care. The first step, and the focus of the NCI cancer genomics programs, is to determine which genomic changes are involved in each type of cancer and to understand the molecular and clinical effects of those changes. Then biomedical researchers must identify or develop treatments to block those effects.</p>
<p>"Right now, cancer research needs something on a very large scale, like the Large Hadron Collider in physics," Haussler said. "Instead of bringing subatomic particles together in high-energy collisions and computing their behavior, we're bringing cancer genomes together in a common database and computing the disease drivers."</p>
<p>CGHub program director is Robert Zimmerman, and project team members include technical director Mark Diekhans; operations manager Linda Rosewood; hardware systems lead Erich Weiler; engineering lead Chris Wilks; engineering consultant Brian Craft; and networking consultants Brad Smith and Jim Warner. The core code, including GT software for downloading data, was licensed from Annai Systems. The cancer genomics group at UCSC also includes co-principal investigator Joshua Stuart, an associate professor of biomolecular engineering at UCSC; assistant research scientist Jing Zhu; engineers Kyle Ellrott, Teresa Swatloski, and Singer Ma; user testing engineer Mary Goldman; postdoctoral scholars Adam Ewing, Benedict Paten, and Daniel Zerbino; research associate Charlie Vaske; and graduate students Tracy Ballinger, Steve Benz, Daniel Carlin, James Durbin, Ted Goldstein, Mia Grifford, Sam Ng, Amie Radenbaugh,&#160; Zack Sanborn, and Chris Szeto.</p>
<p>The CGHub project is 100 percent funded by the National Institutes of Health, in the amount of $10,300,000 using prime contract HHSN261200800001E, from the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.ucsc.edu/features/genomics</url><title>UCSC genomics research</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-folder id="f598f73680727046019c5f730fe0093b"><name>images</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1337029911740</last-published-on><last-published-by>lasnier</last-published-by><path>/2012/05/images</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/05/images</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1335560304411</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1335560304411</last-modified></system-folder><system-page id="096b51778072704601f633b6a365b75a"><name>blumenthal-nci</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC advances fight against cancer</title><summary>Chancellor Blumenthal celebrates the announcement of UCSC's partnership with the National Cancer Institute to establish the Cancer Genomics Hub.</summary><keywords>cancer, nci, genomics, CGHub, hub, haussler, blumehthal, chancellor, personalized medicine</keywords><start-date>1335859200000</start-date><display-name>blumenthal-nci</display-name><path>/2012/05/blumenthal-nci</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/05/blumenthal-nci</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1335892857112</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1335893228938</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz today announced a major stride forward in our collective battle against cancer: In partnership with the National Cancer Institute, we have established the Cancer Genomics Hub (CGHub), a national data repository that will speed advances in our pursuit of personalized approaches to cancer treatment.<br/>

I invite the campus to attend this forum, which will take place on Monday, May 7, in the Namaste Lounge (Colleges Nine and Ten) from 5:30 to 7:00 p.m. <br/>
<br/>
The forum will provide participants with an opportunity to share their ideas and concerns, and to provide feedback to DAG members on draft principles regarding the campus's response to demonstrations. This is your chance to provide input on demonstration-related issues, including communication before and during an action, the role of observers, campus surveillance policies, the student judicial process, and post-demonstration review of police performance. <br/>
<br/>
DAG was <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/04/dag.html">formed</a> a year ago to review campus demonstration practices and policies. At the time, no one anticipated the incidents last fall that emphasized the need for each UC campus to have appropriate, clear, and consistent demonstration policies. I co-chair the group with Helen Shapiro, provost of Colleges Nine and Ten. We have been joined in our work by students, faculty, and staff. Together, we share a commitment to protect the rights, responsibilities, and interests of all members of our campus community. From the outset, we have reviewed campus practices and policies in light of our desire to encourage the exchange of opinions in a context that preserves the welfare of all. <br/>
<br/>
We are eager to share the result of our work to date with you, and look forward to seeing you on Monday, May 7.<br/>

Invito a todas y a todos a asistir a este foro que se llevar&#225; a cabo el lunes 7 de mayo en el Namaste Lounge (Colleges Nine and Ten), desde las 5:30 hasta las 7 de la tarde.<br/>
<br/>
Este foro dar&#225; la oportunidad a las y los participantes&#160; de compartir sus ideas y preocupaciones y proporcionar informaci&#243;n a los miembros del DAG sobre un proyecto de principios con respecto a la respuesta del campus a las manifestaciones. Esta es la oportunidad para que ustedes nos den su opini&#243;n sobre las cuestiones relacionadas con las manifestaciones, incluyendo asuntos como la comunicaci&#243;n antes y durante una acci&#243;n, el papel de las/los observadoras/es, las pol&#237;ticas de vigilancia del campus, el proceso judicial a las y los estudiantes y la revisi&#243;n posterior a la manifestaci&#243;n de la actuaci&#243;n policial.<br/>
<br/>
El DAG <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/04/dag.html">se form&#243;</a> hace un a&#241;o para revisar las pr&#225;cticas y pol&#237;ticas del campus con respecto a las manifestaciones. En ese momento, nadie previ&#243; los incidentes que ocurrieron en el oto&#241;o pasado. Estos hechos enfatizaron la necesidad de que cada campus de la Universidad de California tenga sus pol&#237;ticas de manifestaciones de manera apropiada, clara y consistente. Soy co-directora del grupo con Helen Shapiro, que es provost de los Colleges Nine y Ten. Se han unido a nuestro trabajo estudiantes, profesoras/es&#160; y personal. Juntas y juntos compartimos el compromiso de proteger los derechos, responsabilidades e intereses de todos los miembros de la comunidad de nuestro campus. Desde el comienzo, hemos revisado las pr&#225;cticas y pol&#237;ticas del campus a la luz de nuestro deseo de fomentar el intercambio de opiniones en un contexto que preserve el bienestar de todas y todos.<br/>
<br/>
Estamos muy interesadas/os de compartir el resultado de nuestro trabajo hasta el momento, y esperamos verlas y verlos el lunes 7 de mayo.<br/>

<br/>
It is a pleasure to announce the approval of new doctoral programs in Feminist Studies and Latin American &amp; Latino Studies (LALS), as well as a Master's degree in Theater Arts. Each of these programs reflects the excellence and distinctiveness of scholarship and creative activity at UC Santa Cruz. <br/>
<br/>
In approving the Ph.D. in Feminist Studies, the UC Coordinating Council on Graduate Affairs cited the uniqueness among UC programs of the interdisciplinary and transnational scope of the program, its collaborative approach, and the inclusion of science studies. Reviewers of the interdisciplinary LALS Ph.D. program noted that it will be the first doctorate program in the country to combine analysis of micro- and transnational transformations within the Americas. In Theater Arts, the new one-year Master's program will capitalize on departmental ties with Shakespeare Santa Cruz and other professional venues to prepare students to shape the future of performance. Congratulations to all who contributed to the approval of these outstanding proposals. Faculty are currently collaborating with the Graduate Division to finalize admissions planning; interested students are encouraged to contact departments directly. <br/>
<br/>
The undergraduate curriculum has undergone changes this year as well. The campus has discontinued the Economics dual degree pathway program, which enrolled students from other UC campuses and had not been utilized for many years.<br/>
<br/>
We have also formally suspended admissions for two years to the American Studies major. Students in the major were <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/01/american-studies.html">notified</a> of the proposed suspension in January 2011, and the department is accommodating all declared majors who wish to complete their degrees. In the meantime, American Studies professors &#8211; who initiated the suspension &#8211; are affiliating with other departments, which has created an exciting opportunity for the campus. <br/>
<br/>
With the support of Chancellor Blumenthal and Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway, faculty and students have developed plans for new programs in Critical Race and Ethnic Studies (CRES), including a B.A., a minor, and a graduate "designated emphasis." The next step will be to develop formal proposals for review by the Academic Senate, anticipated in the 2012-13 academic year. Many thanks to Humanities Dean Bill Ladusaw for his leadership on the CRES initiative&#8212;and to everyone who participated in academic planning this year.<br/>

The event takes place from 1:30 to 4:30 p.m. and features student presentations in poster, oral, and multimedia formats.</p>
<p>"Graduate students from across the five divisions, from the arts and cultural disciplines to the sciences and engineering, will present their work," said Tyrus Miller, vice provost and dean of graduate studies. "It's a great opportunity to get to see the emerging research of this new generation of scholars, and the students themselves get the chance to speak to an audience broader than their immediate peers and professional community."</p>
<p>Many graduate students present their work at venues such as specialized conferences for researchers in a particular field. The Graduate Research Symposium encourages students to communicate their research in a way that is engaging and accessible to a more general audience, Miller said. "That's not an easy task, but it's a crucial skill for the subsequent professional careers of our graduate students, and they do a great job at it," he said.</p>
<p>A panel of judges will award prizes for best presentations in each division, as well as best-of-symposium awards. The Terminal Degree Jazz Band will provide entertainment on the veranda throughout the event.</p>

<br/>
Ajay Shah and Ila Patnaik from India's National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), in New Delhi, took part in a one-day workshop that brought together experts in finance and international economics from UCSC, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
The workshop, discussion, and debate was organized by Professor Nirvikar Singh, co-director of UCSC's Sury Initiative on Global Finance and International Risk Management.<br/>
<br/>
Singh said Shah and Patnaik lead the technical team advising the Indian government on reforming its financial sector laws and regulations. Both had visited UCSC before and wanted to return to hear from UCSC's economic experts, specifically on systemic risk: the collapse or potential collapse of an entire financial system or market. The global economic crisis of 2008-2009 was top of mind during discussions of bubbles, credit surpluses or shortages, and tumbling markets.<br/>
<br/>
"We came all this way for this meeting," said Shah.&#160; India requires a trillion dollars of infrastructure investment in coming years, he said, and must reform its financial system in order to attract the investment needed, while also not destabilizing the growing Indian economy. Shah, who has been listed as one of India's top 10 economists, received his Ph.D. in economics from the University of Southern California after earning a BTech in aeronautical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology in Bombay.<br/>
<br/>
Patnaik, a senior fellow at the NIPFP, noted that Singh had brought together academic experts, policymakers, as well as practitioners, which provided Shah and her with a broad perspective for their work ahead.<br/>
<br/>
Also joining the group were UCSC graduate students in macroeconomics, who work under the guidance of economics department chair and monetary policy expert Carl Walsh.<br/>
<br/>
Participants heard presentations from Michael Dooley, Joshua Aizenman, and Michael Hutchison of UCSC; Terrance Odean from UC Berkeley; &#211;scar Jord&#225; of UC Davis and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco; Jose Lopez, vice president of economic research at the Federal Reserve Bank, and Mark Spiegel vice president of international research at the Federal Reserve Bank.<br/>

SIGFIRM was founded at UCSC to guide practitioners and policymakers in an economic world of increased uncertainty, globalization and use of information technology.&#160; It is funded by a generous seed grant from UCSC alumnus Sharath Sury.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2918a5c580727046007f29ad458302eb"><name>gary-young</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Santa Cruz Arts Commission names Humanities lecturer Artist of the Year</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz humanities lecturer Gary Young has been named 2012 Artist of the Year by the Santa Cruz County Arts Commission</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, ucsc. poetry, Santa Cruz poetry, santa cruz artist, humanities awards</keywords><start-date>1336425000000</start-date><display-name>Gary Young 2012 Artist of the Year’</display-name><path>/2012/05/gary-young</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/05/gary-young</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1336424310134</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1338573307557</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Literature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Home Page</value><value>Admissions</value><value>Visit UCSC</value><value>Research</value><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/05/images/gary_young_lead.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/05/images/gary_young_lead.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>gary_young_lead.jpg</name><display-name>gary_young_lead.jpg</display-name><file-size>27648</file-size><width>300</width><height>359</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/05/images/young-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/05/images/young-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>young-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>young-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>23721</file-size><width>81</width><height>81</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Gary Young, UCSC Lecturer in Creative Writing</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Celebration to take place at Museum of Art &amp; History on May 25</article-subhead><article-text><strong>UC Santa Cruz humanities lecturer</strong> Gary Young has been named 2012 Artist of the Year by the Santa Cruz County Arts Commission<br/>

<br/>
Guided by UCSC film and digital media professor Irene Lusztig in her winter quarter <em>Intermediate Documentary Production</em> course, the students spent three months exploring the many different faces of the city of Watsonville.<br/>
<br/>
Every aspect of the project was produced collectively, from research to shooting to editing. Filmed and edited in a patient, meditative observational style, the result is a chronicle of the sights and sounds of Watsonville.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Professor Lusztig noted</strong> that in most of UCSC&#8217;s film production classes, students make several individual short video projects per quarter.<br/>
<br/>
She said that while this model has many benefits&#8212;such as letting students graduate with a nice portfolio--it means that students rarely get to spend time working together on a large project.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;Learning modes of working collaboratively is important,&#8221; said Lusztig. &#8220;Students who go through a process like this not only learn a lot about filmmaking, but also learn a lot about how to negotiate their ideas with other students&#8230;how to be accountable for their work in a group.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Lusztig added that in the real world, most documentary filmmakers do not generally create their projects alone.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;More commonly, documentaries are made by a complex network of collaborators that might include producers, directors, research assistants, cinematographers, sound designers, and many others. These people work together, talk things through, and combine their strengths to make projects.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>The film students basically worked</strong> in research and production groups of two. Each group went on at least four shoots, and they had to come up with their own four topics in Watsonville.<br/>
<br/>
The students spent about three weeks researching and trying to develop contacts in Watsonville, and another four weeks shooting and cutting short scenes out of their video material.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;By week seven, we had collectively generated about 40 hours of footage, which was great,&#8221; said Lusztig. &#8220;One of the benefits of a group project is that you can produce a lot of footage really quickly, which really teaches students about how to work with a high shooting ratio, starting with 40 hours and cutting it down.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Once the class had all of its scenes and put them together, they found their first cut totaled nearly three hours. The students then began the process of many group discussions about structure to make crucial decisions--such as which scenes were working, what to cut, how to order things, and how to start and end the film.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>&#160;All of those editing decisions were</strong> made by consensus. Once the class had a shorter, 80-minute finished edit they were happy with, the students again worked in smaller groups to do tasks like sound mixing and color correction to complete the film.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I think most students had really positive responses to how the process worked, and I think they did amazing work,&#8221; Lusztig observed. &#8220;These students were able to make a feature length film in 10 weeks, which is pretty incredible, and definitely not something one student could do alone.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I'm now teaching a senior projects documentary class with some of the same students, and I am definitely seeing more socially-engaged, research-driven documentary projects than I usually do,&#8221; Lusztig added.&#160; &#8220;So I think the process has been influential.&#8221;<br/>

<p>The event, sponsored by UCSC&#8217;s Staff Advisory Board, was also a chance for Chancellor George Blumenthal to thank staff members for their contributions to UCSC. &#8220;We simply couldn&#8217;t function without you,&#8217;&#8217; he said.</p>
<p>Blumenthal presented <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/04/anne-callahan-outstanding-staff-award.html">this year&#8217;s UCSC Alumni Association Outstanding Staff Award to Anne Callahan</a>. &#160;&#8220;It&#8217;s no wonder people love her here,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The award goes to staffers who go 'above and beyond' to help students or colleagues, improve programs and contribute to the university&#8217;s intellectual and physical environment.</p>
<p>Blumenthal said Callahan, the academic human resources manager for the Humanities Division, and a UCSC employee since 1977, &#160;received "an overwhelming number of nominations" for the award, and that many of her colleagues "just feel they can&#8217;t survive without her."</p>
<p>Upon accepting the award, Callahan, who handles everything from academic leaves and reviews to retirement for her department, said she loved her job, and that the honor is a welcome but unexpected boon. &#8220;Every day something takes my breath away, whether I&#8217;m finding a banana slug rookery or being immersed in a humanities professor&#8217;s groundbreaking research,&#8221; she told the crowd.</p>
<p>After honoring Callahan, Blumenthal himself received a surprise honor for his work on behalf of staff members; that afternoon he was given the Outstanding Senior Leadership Award, which is sponsored and vetted by the <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/cucsa/welcome.php">Counsel of University of California Staff Assemblies</a> (CUCSA), a system-wide UC staff organization.</p>
<p>The picnic also featured an all-staff rock band who covered everything from Al Green&#8217;s &#8220;Take Me To the River&#8221; to the Violent Femmes&#8217; &#8220;Blister in the Sun.&#8221; The event also featured several raffles, as well as information booths handing out everything from ergonomic equipment to Shakespeare Santa Cruz decals. Not surprisingly, the yellow &#8220;100 percent Slug&#8221; buttons ran out quickly.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3823713b807270460039068a88d5433f"><name>campus-elections</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Announcing 2012 Campus Elections </title><summary>2012 Campus Elections are scheduled for next week.</summary><keywords>election</keywords><start-date>1336636800000</start-date><display-name>Announcing 2012 Campus Elections </display-name><path>/2012/05/campus-elections</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/05/campus-elections</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1336676675797</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1336676945627</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>I write to announce that the 2012 Campus Elections are scheduled for next week.&#160; Voting will begin at 12:00 am on May 16th and continue until 11:59 pm on May 22nd.&#160;&#160; All undergraduate students registered for Spring Quarter 2012 are eligible to vote. <br/>

href="http://www.defineamerican.com/page/feature/jose-story">My Life as an Undocumented Immigrant</a>," in the <em>New York Times Magazine</em> last year revealed his immigration status, will be the keynote speaker at the 9th annual C&#233;sar Ch&#225;vez Convocation at UC Santa Cruz.<br/>
<br/>
The convocation will take place Wednesday, May 16, at 7 p.m. in the College Nine &amp; College Ten Multipurpose Room. The convocation is free and open to the public.<br/>
<br/>
Vargas, who reported for the <em>San Francisco Chronicle, Washington Post</em>, and later the <em>Huffington Post</em>, attended high school in Mountain View and graduated from San Francisco State University.<br/>
<br/>
In 2008, he was a member of the Washington Post reporting team that won the Pulitzer Prize for breaking news for its coverage of the mass shooting at Virginia Tech University.<br/>
<br/>
His first-person article in the <em>New York Times</em> last June brought his particular immigration situation and the similar circumstances of millions of other residents to the forefront of political debate.<br/>
<br/>
Since announcing that he was an undocumented immigrant, Vargas has founded <a href="http://www.defineamerican.com">Define American</a>, a new campaign that seeks to change the conversation around immigration reform.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
His experience is a common story for thousands of students nationally, and the more than 12 million immigrants in the U.S. who are undocumented.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Vargas was born and raised in Philippines until age 12 when his mother sent him to live with his grandparents in Silicon Valley. He writes that at age 16, "I rode my bike to the DMV to get my driver's permit. I brought my green card with me. The woman at the DMV looked at it, leaned over and whispered, 'This is fake. Don't come back here again.'<br/>
<br/>
"I went home and confronted my grandfather. He confirmed it. That was the first time I realized I am an undocumented immigrant &#8212; what some people call an 'illegal.'"<br/>
<br/>
An estimated 65,000 students graduate from U.S. high schools each year without legal citizenship or residency.<br/>
<br/>
The C&#233;sar Ch&#225;vez Convocation honors the memory of C&#233;sar Ch&#225;vez, his achievements, commitment to social justice and civil rights, his efforts to cultivate grassroots leaders, and his successful formation of the United Farmworkers Union (UFW). The convocation's goal is to provide a platform to engage the UCSC campus and Santa Cruz community in a dialogue on Latino leadership and social justice issues.<br/>
<br/>
Past keynote speakers have been Dolores Huerta (2004), legendary union organizer and advocate for women and the poor; playwright, screenwriter, filmmaker, and director Luis Valdez (2005); Arturo Rodriquez, UFW president&#160; (2006),; executive secretary-treasurer of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor,&#160; Maria Elena Durazo (2007); performance artist Guillermo G&#243;mez-Pe&#241;a (2008); Kent Wong, director of the UCLA Labor Center (2009);&#160; Mar&#237;a Hinojosa, journalist and managing editor of Latino USA (2010); and Father Gregory Boyle, executive director of Homeboy Industries (2011).&#160;<br/>
<br/>
This year's convocation is produced by College Ten Co-Curricular Programs, El Centro Chicano-Latino Resource Center, and the Asian/Pacific Islander Resource Center and is held in collaboration with Asian-American/Pacific Islander Heritage Month.<br/>

<p>Join the seed project and gain access to its collection of locally adapted heirloom seeds for free.</p>
<p>A seed library is a means by which a community can store and protect its rare heirloom vairities of plants. The event is free to the public and the only stipulation for borrowing seeds is to return 20 times the amount of seeds you borrow for at least two varities. This may sound difficult but it really is not, especially when one considers one&#160;seed&#160;has the potential to produce hundreds of seeds.&#160;</p>
<p>The seed library has been working with local farmers and gardeners to preserve and encourage local food biodiversity. Heirloom species of plants go extinct every day.</p>
<p>By growing seeds from the Demeter&#160;Seed&#160;Library you are directly participating in the preservation of rare&#160;varieties&#160;of delicious vegetables. Plus they look great and&#160;usually&#160;aren't available at markets. Sow the seeds of revolution. Living organisms should not be commodified.</p>
<p>The library is working to create an open-sourced seed encyclopedia and eventually would like to see living seed libraries at universities all over the nation. It is breaking ground on this project and would love for more participants to join.</p>

Topics included Hawaiian prison songs, Japanese-American history, habitat restoration, nanotechnology, stem cell research, and distant planets.</p>
<p>"The Graduate Research Symposium profiles to the campus and broader community the remarkable range and quality of graduate student research at UCSC," said Tyrus Miller, vice provost and dean of graduate studies.</p>
<p>A panel of judges awarded prizes for outstanding presentations in all the divisions. Among the winners was Allan Schwade, a graduate student in linguistics who has been studying the process of "loan word adaptation"--how words from one language are borrowed into another.</p>
<p>Schwade said he always learns a lot from presenting his work to others. "I'm always trying to think about how to explain my work to non-linguists, because it forces you to think about your work from a different perspective. Sometimes you see holes in your thinking that you wouldn't have noticed otherwise," he said.</p>

</article-subhead><article-text><strong>Dead Central, the long-awaited</strong> 1,400-square-foot exhibit space for the Grateful Dead Archive at UC Santa Cruz, is now complete&#8212;thanks to Santa Barbara investor and philanthropist Scott Brittingham.<br/>
<br/>
A longtime supporter of charitable causes ranging from education to social services, he donated $500,000 to help UCSC finish and fully equip Dead Central. <br/>
<br/>
As a result of this generous gift, the sign above the UCSC archive&#8217;s premier exhibition room now reads: <strong>Brittingham Family Foundation Dead Central.</strong><br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I was very happy that I had the ability to do this when there was a need,&#8221; said Brittingham. <br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I had no connection to UC Santa Cruz, and no affiliation with the Grateful Dead. It was a bit outside what we had done previously with the foundation. But I thought it was a great opportunity.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
<strong>A lifelong Southern Californian</strong>, Brittingham is well known in Santa Barbara, where he has led a successful $40 million campaign for the renovation of the Santa Barbara Bowl, the area&#8217;s largest outdoor concert amphitheater.<br/>
<br/>
Brittingham also donated $1 million through his family foundation to restore a wooded park&#8212;now named the Jerry Garcia Glen&#8212;at the Bowl, which features a large bronze sculpture Brittingham commissioned of Garcia&#8217;s distinctive picking hand. <br/>
<br/>
Sculpted by artist Tom White, there are two smaller versions of that piece, one of which will be on permanent display at UCSC&#8217;s Grateful Dead Archive.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;I think it&#8217;s great that UC Santa Cruz won the archive,&#8221; Brittingham notes. &#8220;It&#8217;s such a beautiful campus and has such good traditions. They are certainly showing a lot of respect to the band by prioritizing the collection.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;It&#8217;s great primary source material for academics,&#8221; Brittingham added. &#8220;And I&#8217;m happy to contribute for the benefit of all the fans. If I weren&#8217;t in a position to contribute, I would hope it would be someone else&#8212;that&#8217;s the spirit of the Grateful Dead.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
<strong>The Grateful Dead Archive</strong> represents one of the most significant popular cultural collections of the 20th Century. <br/>
<br/>
It documents the Dead&#8217;s incredible creative activity and influence in contemporary music history from 1965 to 1995, including the phenomena of the Deadheads, its extensive social network of devoted fans, and the band&#8217;s highly unusual and successful musical business ventures.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Brittingham Family Foundation Dead Central</strong> will serve as the showcase arena for original memorabilia gifted to UCSC&#8217;s McHenry Library by the Grateful Dead.<br/>
<br/>
It will also include many pieces created by renowned artists, items contributed by Deadheads, and artifacts and records from the Grateful Dead's offices.<br/>
<br/>
Posters, documents, photographs, instruments, tickets, backstage passes, fan letters, and intricately decorated ticket envelopes are among the items that will fill the exhibit cases. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Rotating exhibitions</strong>, curated by the Grateful Dead Archivist, will be created and installed each year to demonstrate the wide range of resources contained within the Archive. <br/>
<br/>
Short films will additionally be shown in the screening room--which is furnished with high-definition television display--and music and spoken word recordings will also be available for play.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;We feel very fortunate to be able to support the archive,&#8221; said Brittingham. &#8220;It&#8217;s a privilege to have done this.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;And Nick Meriwether&#8212;the Grateful Dead Archivist&#8212;is an amazingly inspired and dedicated individual,&#8221; Brittingham added. &#8220;It&#8217;s in good hands.&#8221;<br/>

<p>A new <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0036728">study</a> published May 15 in the journal <em>PLoS ONE</em> focuses on the annual migrations of adult female elephant seals, with data from nearly 300 animals. The results show elephant seals traveling throughout the entire northeast Pacific Ocean on foraging trips in search of prey such as fish and squid.</p>
<p>"This work is unprecedented in terms of the number of animals tracked. For the first time we can truly say that we know what the elephant seal population is doing," said Daniel Costa, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and leader of the elephant seal research group at UC Santa Cruz. "This represents the efforts of a large number of graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and undergraduate volunteers who have all worked very hard to make this happen."</p>
<p>The researchers found that individual seals pursue a variety of different foraging strategies, but most of them target one oceanographic feature in particular--a boundary zone between two large rotating ocean currents, or gyres. Along this boundary, the cold nutrient-rich waters of the sub-polar gyre in the north mix with the warmer waters of the subtropical gyre, driving the growth of phytoplankton and supporting a robust food web. Presumably, this leads to a concentration of prey along the boundary, said Patrick Robinson, a postdoctoral researcher in Costa's lab and lead author of the paper.</p>
<p>"The highest density of seals is right over that area, so something interesting is definitely going on there," Robinson said.</p>
<p><a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2011/06/costa-topp.html">Previous studies</a> by Costa and other participants in the Tagging of Pacific Predators program have shown that this boundary zone is important for a wide range of marine predators, including elephant seals, sharks, tuna, and albatrosses. A surface feature associated with the boundary zone, caused by blooms of phytoplankton, is detectable in satellite images, but it moves seasonally as much as 1,000 kilometers to the south. The deep-diving elephant seals do not follow this surface feature, but continue to target the deep boundary zone between the two gyres.</p>
<p>Smaller numbers of female elephant seals feed in coastal regions, pursuing bottom-dwelling prey along the continental shelf, or in other areas outside of the boundary zone such as around seamounts. Among these is a large female that feeds near Vancouver Island and holds the record for deepest recorded dive by an elephant seal. The data analyzed in the <em>PLoS ONE</em> paper include one dive to 1,747 meters (5,765 feet, well over a mile), and the same seal dove even deeper on a more recent foraging trip, reaching 1,754 meters (5,788 feet), Robinson said.</p>
<p>Female northern elephant seals make two foraging trips every year. After the breeding season in February and March, they head out to sea for two months before returning to the rookery to molt. Then they leave on a long post-molting migration that often lasts eight months, from June to January. The amount of food a female is able to find on these foraging trips directly affects her breeding success and, if she gives birth, her pup's growth rate and chances of survival.</p>
<p>"If foraging is not good, the pups are smaller at weaning because the females produce less milk," Robinson said.</p>
<p>In addition to tracking the foraging migrations, the researchers monitor the health of the seals and track birth rates over time. Tags are attached harmlessly onto the animals' fur and recovered when they return to the rookery. Before and after each migration, the researchers get weights and blood samples from the tagged seals, which always return to the same rookery. The tags used today are far more sophisticated than the first ones deployed by UCSC researchers in the 1980s. Current devices, used on a subset of the seals in this study, can capture an animal's location, swim speed, and depth and duration of dives, as well as the temperature and salinity of the seawater and how that changes with depth.</p>
<p>Most of the animals in this study were tagged at the rookery on A&#241;o Nuevo Island, where UCSC researchers have been studying elephant seals for decades. But the study also involved a collaboration with researchers in Mexico to tag elephant seals at Islas San Benito, which is 1,150 kilometers (690 miles) southeast of A&#241;o Nuevo. "A lot of those animals travel much further to get to foraging areas in the north, so they might spend an extra week traveling, and we wanted to see how that affects them," Robinson said. "The animals from San Benito that do go up to feed at the boundary zone do fine, but we also found that many of them stayed closer to home, feeding along the continental shelf, and they were successful too."</p>
<p>These findings highlight the adaptability of elephant seals, suggesting that they may be able to withstand environmental perturbations such as climate change because the population is not dependent on a single foraging strategy.</p>
<p>This research is also providing valuable oceanographic data. While ocean surface temperatures can be measured by satellites, oceanographers have limited temperature data from deep waters. Costa's group has organized the temperature data collected by the elephant seals into a format that oceanographers can use and uploaded it to the <a href="http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/indprod.html">World Ocean Database</a>, providing millions of ocean temperature data points not otherwise available.</p>

<p>Rosen, an associate professor of computer engineering in the Baskin School of Engineering, was honored along with top doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals at an awards ceremony on Thursday, May 10, at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View.</p>
<p>Rosen leads the Bionics Lab at UC Santa Cruz, where his research focuses on medical robotics, including robotic surgery and the use of robotics for rehabilitation from stroke and neuromuscular disabilities. His team recently built a set of seven <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/01/robotic-surgery.html">advanced robotic surgery systems</a> and shipped them to major medical research laboratories throughout the United States. Robotic surgery has the potential to enable new surgical procedures that are less invasive than existing techniques. In addition, telesurgery, in which the surgeon operates a robotic system from a remote location, offers the potential to provide better access to expert care in remote areas and the developing world. Having a network of laboratories working on a common platform will make it easier for researchers to collaborate.</p>
<p>Rosen has also developed a wearable robotic "exoskeleton," which could be used for rehabilitation and physical therapy. A clinical trial is currently under way at UCSF to evaluate the use of the robotic exoskeleton for rehabilitation of stroke patients.</p>
<p>Rosen and the other award winners are profiled in a special supplement in the May 11 <em>Silicon Valley/San Jose Business Journal.</em></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5187fd4c8072704601391d27a96507bf"><name>diversity-update-may</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Office for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Update</title><summary>Read who the recipients of the 2012 Chancellor’s Achievement Awards for Diversity are here.</summary><keywords>diversity</keywords><start-date>1337068800000</start-date><display-name>Office for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Update</display-name><path>/2012/05/diversity-update-may</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/05/diversity-update-may</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1337102695627</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1337102695627</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>It is my pleasure to announce the recipients of the <a href="http://diversity.ucsc.edu/diversity/caafd.html">2012 Chancellor&#8217;s Achievement Awards for Diversity</a>.

<p>&#160;<a href="http://diversity.ucsc.edu/training/certificate.html">UCSC&#8217;s Diversity and Inclusion Certificate Program</a>, which has been open to staff employees for the first two years, will also be open to faculty beginning in 2012-2013. This eight-course certificate program is an opportunity for professional development on diversity and inclusion issues. It is designed to offer participants an examination on the many differences that exist in our community, and to gain a greater understanding of how we can work together to build a stronger community on campus. Staff and faculty interested in participating in this program can contact ODEI at <a href="mailto:diversity@ucsc.edu">diversity@ucsc.edu</a>.</p>
<p>I would like to take this opportunity to tell you about two campus events happening in May. The Ninth Annual C&#233;sar Ch&#225;vez Convocation is on May16th at 7:00 pm in the College Nine and College Ten Multipurpose Room. This year&#8217;s convocation is held in collaboration with Asian American/Pacific Islander Heritage Month and the convocation speaker will be Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Jos&#233; Antonio Vargas.</p>
<p>&#160;On May 23<sup>rd</sup> at 4:00 pm in the College Nine and College Ten Multipurpose Room, Dr. David Hayes-Bautista, professor at UCLA, will be speaking on the historical and contemporary significance of the Cinco de Mayo holiday in his talk: &#8220;El Cinco de Mayo: An American Tradition.&#8221;</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t miss out on these great events!</p>
<p>As always, you can contact the Office for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at <a href="mailto:diversity@ucsc.edu">diversity@ucsc.edu</a>.</p>

<br/>
The <a href="http://www.woodrow.org/higher-education-fellowships/religion_ethics/index.php">Newcombe Fellowships</a>, administered by the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, is the nation's largest and most prestigious award for Ph.D. candidates in the humanities and social sciences addressing questions of ethical and religious values. Bakker said the $25,000 fellowship means she will be able to write her dissertation over the next year without having to teach or TA. Of 550 candidates, 21 winners were selected. They attend 13 of the top universities in the nation.<br/>
<br/>
Bakker is Dutch and American by birth, and as a scholar has had a long fascination with Christianity. Her work involves the Syriac Orthodox Christian community in the Netherlands, refugees from the Middle East who have fled violent conflict in their native countries. Her dissertation is titled "Fragments of a Liturgical world: Syriac Christianity and the Dutch Multiculturalism Debates."<br/>
<br/>
A year ago, she was the first UCSC student to win the Paper Prize from the Society for the Anthropology of Europe. Previously, she won major grants in support of her research including the Social Science Research Council's International Dissertation Research Fellowship and the Wenner-Gren Foundation's Dissertation Research Fellowship for anthropological research.<br/>
<br/>
If all goes to plan, Bakker expects to graduate next year. This quarter she is teaching Writing 2 in the writing program, the fourth quarter she has done so. She taught Anthropology of Europe during the winter quarter and Introduction to Cultural Anthropology last summer.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5257d29d8072704601391d27c80963f3"><name>college-provosts</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New provosts named for College Eight, Merrill</title><summary>Richard Hughey, vice provost and dean of undergradute education, has announced the appointments of two new college provosts: Ronnie Lipschutz, at College Eight; and Elizabeth Abrams, at Merrill.</summary><keywords>College Eight provost, Merrill College provost, Ronnie Lipschutz, Elizabeth Abrams</keywords><start-date>1337094000000</start-date><display-name>New provosts named for College Eight, Merrill</display-name><path>/2012/05/college-provosts</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/05/college-provosts</link><created-by>jrburns</created-by><created-on>1337116316200</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1337361368560</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Appointments</value><value>Administration</value><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>UCSC Public Affairs</name><title></title><phone/><email>pio@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Richard Hughey, vice provost and dean of undergraduate education, has announced the appointments of two new college provosts: Ronnie Lipschutz, at College Eight; and Elizabeth Abrams, at Merrill.

The app also includes redesigned emergency features.</p>
<p>In addition to the development of the version 2 iPhone app, the two alumni who have worked with the campus on its mobile application have also developed an Android version of the UC Santa Cruz app.</p>
<p>Both the iPhone and Android versions of the campus app also provide students and others with with regularly updated campus news, events listings, videos,&#160;photos, events, and Google maps functionality.</p>
<p>The iPhone app &#8212; featuring the smiling, bespectacled Sammy the Slug mascot &#8212; first went live in September 2010, thanks to a collaborative effort involving former UCSC students Kushyar Kasraie and Jamieson Johnson, as well as&#160;staff from the campus's University Relations and Information Technology Services divisions.</p>
<p>Kasraie and Johnson &#8212; whose&#160;<a href="http://icamp.us/">iCampus</a>&#160;company has helped develop similar apps at Brandeis University, San Diego State University, Yale University, and Lewis University &#8212; said the UCSC app is the perfect way for busy, multi-tasking students to keep up with life at UC Santa Cruz. "We could have really used this app on our phones when we were students on campus," Kasraie says. Adds Johnson: "Now that we are UCSC graduates, it is still very useful, enabling us to keep up with campus news and events. But, really, it's available for faculty and staff, parents of current students, campus visitors, and anyone else to&#160;download for free."</p>
<p>Both Kasraie and Johnson graduated from UCSC with bachelor's degrees in Business Management Economics: Kushyar (College Nine) in '09; Johnson (Cowell), earlier in 2012.</p>
<p>Kasraie said the idea of an iPhone app occurred to him when he was still at UCSC.</p>

<p>The Dean's Forum on the Economic Crisis will bring together researchers currently teaching at UC Santa Cruz with other scholars who graduated from UCSC before launching distinguished academic careers.</p>
<p>"Although media attention has focused, understandably, on the financial and regulatory issues underlying the economic crisis, this forum examines the impact of the global recession on many different aspects of society as well as our economic system," said Sheldon Kamieniecki, dean of Social Sciences. "We hope that students who are living through this historical period will gain insights into the effects of the financial crisis on both our economic system, in particular, and various segments of society, more generally."</p>
<p>The morning session from 10 a.m. to noon will analyze the causes of the most dire economic crisis since the Great Depression with politics chair Kent Eaton moderating. Economics professor Michael Dooley, who joined UCSC 20 years ago after working for 20 years with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and International Monetary Fund, will present an overview of the causes of the crisis and an assessment of current conditions. Commenting will be Ben Crow, chair of sociology, Ronnie Lipschutz, politics; and Nirvikar Singh, economics.<br/>
<br/>
The afternoon session, "Effects of the Economic Crisis and Future Well Being of Society," will take place from 1:30-3:30 p.m. Featured speaker will be Barry Eichengreen (Stevenson, '74, economics and politics), who is renowned for his examination of the world&#8217;s financial system at its most perilous turning points. He is now a UC Berkeley professor of economics and political science. Psychology chair Avril Thorne will moderate.<br/>
<br/>
Joining them will be Eva Bertram, politics; Heather Bullock, psychology; Steven McKay, sociology; Robert Meister, social sciences; and Manuel Pastor (Merrill, '78, economics and English literature), a former UCSC professor who now teaches American studies and ethnicity at the University of Southern California.<br/>
<br/>
The forum is part of the Bruce Initiative on Rethinking Capitalism at UCSC. It is sponsored by the Division of Social Sciences, and co-sponsored by the Sury Initiative for Global Finance and International Risk Management.<br/>

<br/>
Founder of the popular San Francisco-based web magazine <em>Salon</em>, Talbot has been hailed as a &#8220;web pioneer&#8221; by the <em>New York Times</em>, as well as "one of 50 people who matter most in the new media world" by <em>Newsweek</em>.<br/>
<br/>
The UC Santa Cruz alum (Stevenson '73, sociology) is also the author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling book, <em>Brothers: The Hidden History of the Kennedy Years</em>, and <em>Devil Dog: The Amazing True Story of the Man Who Saved America</em>. <br/>
<br/>
Talbot has additionally written for <em>The New Yorker, Rolling Stone</em>, and <em>Time</em>; served as a senior editor for <em>Mother Jones</em> magazine; and was a features editor for the <em>San Francisco Examiner</em>.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Talbot will read from his latest book</strong>, <em>Season of the Witch: Enchantment, Terror and Deliverance in the City of Love</em>&#8212;a dynamic story of the turbulent years in San Francisco from 1967 to 1982. <br/>
<br/>
The epicenter of the cultural revolution in the late 1960s, San Francisco was already afflicted with brutal murders, political assassinations, street riots, and a terrifying sexual epidemic by the beginning of the 1980s. <br/>
<br/>
Digging deep into the harrowing story of the city&#8217;s ascent, decline, and recovery, Talbot draws intimate portraits of San Francisco&#8217;s legendary figures&#8212;from <strong>Charles Manson, Patty Hears</strong>t and the <strong>Symbionese Liberation Army</strong>; to J<strong>erry Garcia, Janis Joplin</strong>, and <strong>Bill Graham</strong>; to <strong>Herb Caen, Harvey Milk, Jim Jones</strong> and the <strong>Peoples Temple</strong>; to <strong>Joe Montana</strong> and the <strong>Super Bowl 49er</strong>s. <br/>
<br/>
The book is described by <strong>Oliver Stone</strong> as &#8220;a fresh, fun, vigorous look at a strange American city David Talbot knows well and loves with irony.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Actor and author <strong>Peter Coyote</strong> noted: &#8220;David Talbot is a great story-teller. He writes like an angel and has a reporter&#8217;s passion for the truth&#8230; He got it all just right and gets closer to describing the lusty, languorous, glamorous, and sometimes lethal Saint named Francisco than anyone I know. The book overflows with gifts. I&#8217;m in awe of it.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Talbot credits UC Santa Cruz</strong> with changing his life&#8212;opening his eyes and teaching him how to think and work in the real world. As he told a writer a few years back in UCSC&#8217;s <em>Review</em> alumni magazine: <br/>
<br/>
"That spirit of jumping into the void and being terrified and exhilarated-all that was familiar to me from my years in college. It really shaped my sense of self, a self that embraces risk as a necessary part of innovation.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
Admission to UCSC&#8217;s May 22 event with David Talbot is free and open to the public. <br/>

<br/>
The team, led by Winifred F. Frick (Porter, '98, environmental studies), a researcher in the ecology and evolutionary biology (EEB) department and A. Marm Kilpatrick, an EEB assistant professor, has received a $196,000 grant from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Joining them in the research are graduate students Tina Cheng and Joe Hoyt.<br/>
<br/>
The grant is part of a $1.4 million effort by USFWS to continue the investigation into white-nose syndrome that has killed more than 5.5 million little brown bats since it was first detected in 2006. White-nose syndrome has spread rapidly across the eastern U.S. and into Canada.<br/>
<br/>
Frick was a lead author of a 2010 study that identified the fungus that is killing the bats by disrupting their winter hibernation, causing them to awaken early and lose body fat before food sources become active. When healthy, these bats can consume their body weight in insects each night, Frick said.<br/>
<br/>
"Bats are crucial to our nation's ecosystems and our economy," said USFWS director Dan Ashe, calling the bat deaths "an unprecedented wildlife crisis."<br/>
<br/>
Frick said Cheng, a Ph.D. student in EEB, wrote the majority of the proposal "Antifungal Skin Microbes as Tools for WNS Management." It is inspired by similar work that has been done by researchers studying the fungus-caused deaths of a frog species in the Sierra Nevada.<br/>
<br/>
"We want to mitigate its impact on bat populations," Cheng said. "Our best bet for bat conservation is to find a way to give bats a fighting chance against the infection."</p>
<p>Cheng received her master's degree in biology from San Francisco State University, working with professor Vance Vredenburg. Vredenburg worked with collaborators at James Madison University to study the rapid die-off of the Sierra Nevada mountain yellow-legged frog due to a fast-acting fungus. They discovered and were able to show that augmenting a type of naturally-occurring skin microbe &#8211; <em>Janthinobacterium lividum</em> (commonly called <em>J-liv</em>) &#8211; to the frogs' backs resulted in healthier frogs that, though infected, were still able to survive.<br/>
<br/>
"It was a really huge breakthrough, the first glimmer of hope we could do something that would convey benefit to the frogs and prevent local extinction," Cheng said. She helped with the project and will be a co-author of the resulting paper.<br/>
<br/>
She also studied the decline and extirpation in the 1970s of a high-altitude salamander in Latin America, a task she compared with "Unsolved Mysteries." "You do a lot of detective work to try to go back and find what it was that caused these extinctions," she said.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng and others want to see if using the same antifungal skin microbe can empower the bat to resist the deadly fungus and prevent extinction.<br/>
<br/>
Cheng said the USFWS has tried using anti-fungal chemicals on the bats without success, and is now interested in finding a method that is more biologically friendly.<br/>
<br/>
Frick said the work involves doing laboratory experiments to identify bacteria or fungi that naturally occur on bat skin that could help inhibit growth and reduce the infection of the fungus that causes white-nose syndrome. Then they will conduct experimental trials to see if these microbial agents can increase survival of bats exposed to the infection.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
Cheng will work on the project as part of her doctoral thesis. Hoyt, an incoming master's student in EEB who formerly worked with the New York Department of Environmental Conservation, has already done preliminary work on microbes that inhibit the fungus growth. The project will be the topic of his master's thesis as well.<br/>

 <br/>
 Starting this week and continuing through the end of July, increased truck traffic will travel to the reservoir via Mission Street, Bay Street, Iowa Drive, and Cardiff Place weekdays between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. At peak times, as many as 10 trucks per hour may traverse this route. Commuter traffic, bicyclists, and pedestrians should use extra caution as they approach large, slow-moving trucks traveling along this route.<br/>
 <br/>

<div>
<div><span><br/>
Until further notice, please avoid that area of campus. Hagar Drive, from the entrance to the East Remote parking lot up to Steinhart Way near the bookstore, has been blocked to motorists. Pedestrians should also avoid that area.<br/>
<br/>
As a precaution, OPERS staff have been evacuated from offices in that area, and activities at the OPERS complex have been suspended.<br/>
<br/>
Updates will be posted on the UCSC home page at&#160;<a href="http://www.ucsc.edu">http://www.ucsc.edu</a>.</span></div>

<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>This action is being taken with the unanimous support of the SUA Elections Commission, the Campus Elections Commissioner, the Dean of&#160;Students Office, and the Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>The decision to put the undergraduate elections on hold was made with careful and thorough deliberation. The decision-makers considered all&#160;alternatives and possible negative impacts to all parties involved.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>The reason for this action is that the applications for SUA office candidacy (Elections Packets) were not made available to all&#160;undergraduates for the required 20 working days. Elections Packets were made available for only 12 working days.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>Therefore in order to ensure a valid undergraduate election, the following steps will be taken:</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>1.&#160;&#160;All undergraduate voting and campaigning will end as of 8:00 am on Friday, May 18, 2012;</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>2.&#160;&#160;All undergraduate votes and candidate endorsements to date will be nullified;</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>3.&#160;&#160;Applications for SUA Officer Candidacy (Elections Packets) will be available as of 8:00 am on Friday, May 18,&#160;2012;&#160;&#160;(Note:&#160;&#160;SUA Officer&#160;candidates that have already been approved do not need to re-petition);</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>4. &#160;Applications will be accepted for an additional 8 working days, from Friday, May 18, 2012 through 5:00 pm on Wednesday, May 30, 2012;</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>5.&#160;&#160;The undergraduate ballot will be updated and voting will commence on Friday, June 1, 2012 at 12:00 am and end on Thursday, June 7, 2012&#160;at 11:59 pm.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>6. &#160;Campaigning for SUA Officer candidacy will commence on Friday, June 1, 2012 at 12:00 am.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>Please note that no changes have been made to the graduate student ballot.&#160;&#160;Graduate student voting continues until 11:59 pm on Tuesday, May&#160;22, 2012.</span></div>
<div><span><br/>
</span></div>
<div><span>Every effort will be made to lessen the impacts to candidates, volunteers, and undergraduate voters. Inquires, suggestions, and questions&#160;may be sent to&#160;<a href="mailto:deanofstudents@ucsc.edu">deanofstudents@ucsc.edu</a>.<br/>

<br/>
The 2012 student exhibition will include large-scale works in drawing, painting, sculpture, installation, new media, video, printmaking, and photography.<br/>
<br/>
&#160;&#8220;The work in this exhibition covers the spectrum--from art's traditions, figure and landscape paintings, to emergent forms such as 3-D animation," noted UC Santa Cruz art professor Frank Galuszka. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>The William Hyde and Susan Benteen Irwin Scholarship Fund</strong> was established in 1986, generating annual merit scholarships furthering the education of selected UCSC art students. <br/>
<br/>
Scholarships are granted each year to 12 outstanding students, selected for their academic excellence, creativity, and potential. <br/>
<br/>
The opening reception takes place on Wednesday, May 23, from 5 to 7 p.m. <br/>
<br/>

Given each spring by the Academic Senate's Committee on Teaching, the awards honor UCSC instructors who have demonstrated exemplary and inspiring teaching.<br/>
<br/>
Nominations are submitted by students. The senate committee also reads a statement on teaching written by the nominee, as well as a letter from the department chair. The committee looks for evidence that the nominee has thought deeply about teaching and learning, and effectively applies that thinking in the classroom.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s awards were presented by UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal at the Stevenson Event Center on campus. Most of the teaching awards include a prize of $500, with the exception of the Ron Ruby Award for Teaching Excellence in the Physical and Biological Sciences, which includes a $750 prize.</p>
<p>The winners, with excerpts from the student nominations:</p>
<p>Andrew Fisher, earth &amp; planetary sciences, &#8220;for being friendly, caring and approachable, making even the least intuitive concepts understandable, lecturing with great clarity and going out of his way to support student learning outside the classroom, and caring about the success of his students. His sense of humor keeps difficult material interesting. One student was inspired to change majors after taking his lower-division geology class.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bakthan Singaram, chemistry and biochemistry, who is receiving the Ron Ruby Award for Teaching Excellence in the Physical and Biological Sciences, &#8220;for making organic chemistry enjoyable, applying class material to everyday life, using excellent communication skills, holding office hours four days a week, and inspiring students to do their best."</p>
<p>Deborah Gould, sociology, &#8220;for inspiring students to get involved and make the world a better place, encouraging them to look toward the future and offer solutions. Her &#8216;no Powerpoint&#8217; policy creates an environment for great discussion and critical thinking. She encourages everyone to participate. Many of her lectures receive a round of applause.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gabriel Elkaim, computer engineering, &#8220;for his passionate engagement with computer robotics. He pushes his students to learn the material and complete their projects, and while he expects &#8216;an absurd amount of hours,&#8217; he puts in the hours with his students and stays late. Several mentioned an impromptu lecture he gave after midnight on a Friday when, after checking in on a lab, he realized students needed help understanding the material. He doesn&#8217;t just teach; he lives and breathes his work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lora Bartlett, education, &#8220;for teaching with a fiery passion, reminding students why they want to be educators with her engaging style. She has also been described as an inspiring for undergraduate and graduate-division scholars. One student called her &#8216;the most influential professor I&#8217;ve ever had&#8217; while a doctoral student said her Qualitative Research Methods course will be invaluable during the dissertation phase.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nandini Bhattacharya, mathematics, &#8220;for being helpful, straightforward, fair, caring, approachable and understanding. One student said her class is all you could ever ask for in a math class. This masterful lecturer prepares students to continue in mathematics. She even makes students laugh &#8211; no easy feat in an 8 a.m. class.&#8221;</p>
<p>Paul Nauert, music, &#8220;for his profound understanding of the course material, and for being thorough, caring, patient, enthusiastic and practical. Inspired by his optimism, kind-heartedness and refreshing sense of humor, students call attention to his clear, detailed, well-structured lectures.&#8221;</p>
<p>Steven Ritz, physics, &#8220;for setting the &#8216;gold standard&#8217; for physics education with his caring, approachable style, his responsiveness to student questions, his willingness to set up additional small group meetings to talks with students, and his ability to make &#8216;mind-boggling&#8217; ideas understandable, while connecting them seamlessly to equations. He also makes lectures relevant to real life.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="754bd0d68072704601bd13aa23c1f6a8"><name>galloway-searches</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Senior leadership searches</title><summary>Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway announces upcoming visits by the finalists for two senior leadership posts.</summary><keywords>searches, galloway, dean, BAS, vice chancellor, business and administrative services, physical and biological sciences</keywords><start-date>1337673600000</start-date><display-name>galloway-searches</display-name><path>/2012/05/galloway-searches</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/05/galloway-searches</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1337702731889</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1337702910889</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Unit Managers: Please post a paper copy of this message in your area for people who do not have regular computer access.<br/>

At least 17 lemur species have gone extinct in the past 2,000 years. Photo by Brooke Crowley.</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>The disappearance of one species does not necessarily allow remaining competitor species to thrive by filling now-empty niches, according to a new study of extinct and living lemur species in Madagascar. The study suggests that the factors driving lemur species extinctions for the past 2,000 years have also sparked an ongoing "ecological retreat" by surviving species.</p>
<p>At least 17 species of lemurs have vanished from Madagascar since the arrival of humans about 2,000 years ago. New research by a team of scientists from UC Santa Cruz and other institutions examined eight of those extinctions, and the findings show that surviving species don't necessarily benefit when their competitors die out. Instead, the remaining lemur species appear to have been forced into ecological niches that were largely unoccupied by lemurs in the past.</p>
<p>The study, published online May 23 in <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B,</em> suggests that ecological retreat can result in new selective and ecological pressures that then increase the extinction risk of surviving species, potentially creating an "extinction cascade."</p>
<p>Lead author Brooke Crowley, now an assistant professor of anthropology and geology at the University of Cincinnati, conducted the study for her doctoral thesis at UC Santa Cruz, where she earned a Ph.D. in ecology and evolutionary biology (as well as master's degrees in Earth sciences and anthropology). At UCSC she worked with Paul Koch, professor of Earth and planetary sciences, and anthropologist Nathaniel Dominy, now at Dartmouth College, both of whom are coauthors of the paper. The other coauthors are Laurie Godfrey of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and Tom Guilderson and Paula Zerme&#241;o of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.</p>
<p>"Beyond its implications for the ecology and conservation of lemurs, this research shows the power of the historical approach to ecology," Koch said. "Scientific observations over the past few centuries are rich in details, but they're typically made on species or ecosystems that have been highly altered by human actions. With information from deeper in time, we get a more complete view of the range of interactions and behaviors that a species is capable of, and we can study how they respond to climate change, extinction events, or introduced species."</p>
<p>Using radiocarbon and isotope analysis from fossils of eight large-bodied lemur species that have died out in Madagascar since the arrival of humans, the research team was able to determine the type of habitat in which lemurs in the past lived, their diets, when they died out, and whether other still-extant species filled vacated environmental niches.</p>
<p>The findings show that prior to extensive human disturbance, lemurs were very common in Madagascar's open habitats of wooded savannah and spiny thicket, which constitute the majority of southwestern Madagascar today. But after the larger-sized lemurs that once inhabited those regions went extinct, related species that existed then and are still extant today could not fill the empty niches. Instead, still-extant lemur species have shown, over time, an increasing reliance on habitats with dense forest cover.&#160;</p>
<p>"The reasons behind the increased reliance on densely forested habitats are uncertain, but it's likely that low hunting and logging pressures in forest reserves are contributing factors," Crowley said.</p>
<p>She added that while forested areas have experienced human disturbance, even greater disturbance has been documented in the unprotected open, drier areas where lemur species once flourished but have gone extinct.</p>
<p>According to Godfrey, it's not that lemur species of the past two millennia did not live in forested areas at all, nor that today's species live only in forested areas. Rather, lemur species were once very common in drier and more open habitats in Madagascar, so species were not so heavily reliant on forest habitat as they are today.</p>
<p>"It's been assumed that lemurs were in the forests because that's where the resources that best suited them were," Crowley added. "Our fossil analysis shows that lemur species once preferred a much wider, more distinctive habitat range, which may mean that modern lemurs prefer the densely forested areas simply because these areas offer greater protection. The forest is more of a refuge."</p>
<p>If so, this could help explain previously reported findings by other researchers indicating "mismatches" between lemur anatomy and observed behavior of modern lemurs in the dense forest environments. Such mismatches could be indications that today's lemurs are in ecological retreat and at risk if conservation and environmental management efforts don't take into account what were once, and may likely still be, their preferred habitats.</p>
<p>"In other words," Crowley said, "we now have long-term historical data, a broadened historical perspective indicating that what lemurs are doing today--preferring densely forested areas--is not representative of their ecological niche over past millennia. That's an indication that we need to rethink our assumptions on their current habitat choices and on our own conservation efforts. And this form of historically informed research can also be applied to other locales and animals to benefit threatened species."</p>

<p>The campus has been named one of California&#8217;s two most sustainable colleges, according to a brand-new survey by the Princeton Review in conjunction with the U.S. Green Building Council.</p>
<p>According to the results of the survey, which were released this week, UCSC has a top spot on a "Green Honor Roll." This elite list consists of 16 schools, which were culled from 320 U.S. &#8211; and two Canadian &#8211; colleges and universities.</p>
<p>According to a web story <a href="http://www.scpr.org/blogs/environment/2012/05/11/6089/two-california-schools-among-americas-most-sustain/">posted on Southern California Public Radio</a>&#8217;s blog, the rankings were based on campus green initiatives, "the degree to which sustainability is embedded in the course curriculum, and how well the school prepares students for green jobs upon graduation."</p>
<p>The story also notes that UCSC is "already ranked among the top ten green power purchasing schools in America. The Santa Cruz campus was noted for a 70 percent waste diversion rate, and for gleaning 20 percent of all energy from renewable sources."</p>
<p>San Francisco State University was the other California school to earn a spot on the honor roll.</p>
<p>In addition to this national honor, UCSC is getting some much-deserved green recognition for its Physical Plant Energy Department, which recently won two statewide <a href="http://cahigheredusustainability.org/awards/2012Winners.aspx">Higher Education Best Practice Awards</a> for a campus-wide lighting design and retrofit, and for its water management and improvement efficiency plan.&#160;</p>
<p>These new distinctions can be added to a long list of recognitions for green-minded practices ranging from its food sourcing to its recycling and composing and "zero-impact" move-out days. The Sierra Club, North America&#8217;s oldest and most influential environmental organization, which consistently rates UCSC as one&#160; "the nation&#8217;s most planet-minded universities."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="802af2498072704600ba2d0723bc5732"><name>owls</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Fledging season for owls means clumsy chicks on the ground</title><summary>Experts says it's normal to see owl chicks on the ground, and they should be left alone.</summary><keywords>great horned owl, owls, Bruce Lyon</keywords><start-date>1337846400000</start-date><display-name>Fledging season for owls</display-name><path>/2012/05/owls</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/05/owls</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1337885127110</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1337885231107</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Home Page</value><value>About UCSC</value><value>Campus Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/05/images/owl-325.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/05/images/owl-325.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>owl-325.jpg</name><display-name>owl-325.jpg</display-name><file-size>101984</file-size><width>325</width><height>411</height></image><image-alt>great horned owl</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2012/05/images/owl-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2012/05/images/owl-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>owl-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>owl-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>25686</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>great horned owl</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>An adult great horned owl perched in a redwood tree on the UCSC campus.

Soon the chicks will be leaving their nests, and people may be startled to see a baby owl on the ground in the middle of campus. This is normal, experts say, and people should not approach or pick up a baby owl.</p>
<p>"It's normal for them to be on the ground for the first couple of days after fledging, wandering around in the underbrush," said Bruce Lyon, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology. "The parents are nearby, they will feed the chick at night, and people should just leave the birds alone."</p>
<p>Lyon said he is aware of at least one nest that is near a busy path on campus, so it is quite possible that chicks from that nest could end up on the ground where they would be visible to passers by. He emphasized that the birds don't need to be "rescued," unless one is clearly injured or is being harassed by people. If an animal is injured or in harm's way, people should not approach it themselves, but should contact Native Animal Rescue at 462-0726 or county animal control at 454-7227.</p>
<p>"Great horned owls are pretty spectacular birds. The adults are often seen perched in trees near campus buildings--it's another reminder of what a special campus we have," Lyon said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="803022778072704600ba2d0732363032"><name>spring-opera</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title> Music Department’s Spring Opera ‘Little Women’ opens May 31</title><summary>Each spring, the UCSC Music Department offers up a major opera production--the only fully staged, live opera presentation in Santa Cruz County.

<br/>
This year it will present American composer Mark Adamo's <em>Little Women,</em> based on the popular novel by Louisa May Alcott.<br/>
<br/>
Performances take place at the UCSC Music Center Recital Hall from May 31 to June 3.<br/>
<br/>
Directed by Brian Staufenbiel, head of UCSC&#8217;s Opera Program, the production will feature the UCSC Chamber Orchestra, conducted by music professor Nicole Paiement.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Paiement and Staufenbiel mentor</strong> UCSC students throughout the year to prepare the musicians and singers for the challenging annual event. <br/>
<br/>
The singers not only need to memorize the music and scripts, learn to effectively project their voices, and act convincingly, they also are required to study French, Italian and German as part of the opera program.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Staufenbiel observed that</strong> UCSC is one of the few public universities where an undergraduate student has the opportunity to get this level of experience.<br/>
<br/>
"We chose to stage <em>Little Women</em> because we are very interested in contemporary opera, and this provides a great initiation to contemporary opera for our singers,&#8221; Staufenbiel noted. <br/>
<br/>
&#8220;It's important for them to sing opera of a living composer,&#8221; he added. &#8220;And we have the singers capable of performing this music." <br/>
<br/>
<strong>Paiement described the intense</strong> commitment required by students to make such a complex production possible.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;We audition in spring for the following year, so our students can go home and learn the music during the summer," said Paiement. <br/>
<br/>
&#8220;In the fall and winter quarters the students continue their work, and by the time spring arrives, students are likely to be rehearsing nearly every day. <br/>
<br/>
"We are providing a lot of experience to our singers," she added. <br/>
&#160;<br/>
<strong>Paiement is director of ensembles</strong> at UCSC, where she conducts the Orchestra, the Chamber Singers and the Opera. She is also the artistic director of the San Francisco Conservatory of Music New Music Ensemble, as well the San Francisco-based Ensemble Parall&#232;le.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this year, Paiement conducted Ensemble Parall&#232;le's world-premiere production of the chamber version of John Harbison&#8217;s <em>The Great Gatsby</em>. And in March, she made her Dallas Opera debut conducting Peter Maxwell Davies&#8217; <em>The Lighthouse</em>. <br/>
<br/>
<strong>In addition to teaching voice</strong> and directing UCSC&#8217;s Opera Program, Staufenbiel is an active stage director in the San Francisco Bay Area.<br/>
<br/>
His work directing contemporary opera has included the world premiere of Lou Harrison&#8217;s <em>Young Caesa</em>r; the West Coast premiere of John Rea&#8217;s re-orchestration of Berg&#8217;s <em>Wozzec</em>k; <em>Madame Butterfly</em> with Festival Opera; and the San Francisco premiere of Philip Glass&#8217; <em>Orph&#233;e</em> with Ensemble Parall&#232;le.<br/>

Afterward (weather permitting), audience members can view through the historic 36-inch Lick Telescope or the Nickel 40-inch telescope. A cadre of knowledgeable volunteers assist in these events by sharing their own telescopes and expertise with interested members of the audience.</p>
<p><em>Music of the Spheres</em> concerts will take place on June 16 and 30, July 14 and 28, and August 11 and 25. Scheduled performances include the Singing Strings Trio, featuring soprano Mary Rawcliffe, cellist Virginia Kron, and harpist Jennifer Sayre; Strings of Fire, featuring Latin harp virtuoso Ramon Romero; Grammy-winning artists Eric Tingstad (guitar) and Nancy Rumbel (wind instruments); Scottish music by the Highland Way Duo; jazz by the Kurt Ribak Trio; and Great Guitars, featuring Daniel Roest and Alex de Grassi.</p>
<p>Tickets for each <em>Music of the Spheres</em> evening are offered at three levels: general ($40), preferred ($90), and VIP ($150). All tickets include the concert, astronomy talk, viewing session, and a commemorative wineglass or coffee cup. Preferred ticket holders have the additional benefits of reserved seating and a 20 percent discount at the gift shop. A VIP ticket further entitles visitors to a behind-the-scenes tour of the 120-inch Shane reflecting telescope and a catered buffet before the concert, as well as front-and-center seating.</p>

<br/>
About 100 veterans are currently enrolled at UCSC, and their presence adds to the diversity of experience and viewpoints on our campus. Our goal is to increase access for veterans from all branches of the military: the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard. California is currently home to 25 percent of all veterans who receive education benefits. The number of veteran students will only go up as service men and women return from Iraq and Afghanistan. At UCSC, we are committed to serving those who served. <br/>
<br/>
Our campus has developed a comprehensive network of services that has become a national model, and we are proud to support these motivated students. The success of our program is directly linked to the participation of veteran students in the development of our services. They told us what they needed, and we responded.<br/>
<br/>
Two core features distinguish our services: A peer mentor support program provides veteran-to-veteran counseling and advising under the supervision of a part-time veteran student coordinator. And staff across campus provide assistance with admissions, enrollment, housing, financial aid, and more. <br/>
<br/>
Resources are available through the <a href="http://stars.ucsc.edu/veteran.html">Veterans Education Team Support</a> (VETS) office, which is part of <a href="http://stars.ucsc.edu/index.html">Services for Transfer and Re-entry Students</a> (STARS) in the Academic Resources Center.<br/>
<br/>
Also, 12 <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/03/scholarships-student-veterans.html">scholarships</a> of $500 each were awarded this year to current veteran students, including five funded by the UCSC Retirees Association Bruce Lane Memorial Award fund. That endowment honors former campus planner and US Army veteran Bruce C. Lane, whose 27-year career at UCSC began in 1964. <br/>
<br/>
We are grateful to our veteran students and ask that you take a moment this weekend to reflect on the origins of Memorial Day.<br/>

<br/>
 Painting began this week near the Namaste Lounge after a collaborative process both online and in person to create a design. Dedication is set for 12:30-1 p.m. Tuesday, May 29.<br/>
<br/>
 The project is collaborative from concept to design to implementation, says Diana Gilon, the chief collaborator or better yet, facilitator.<br/>
<br/>
 Since last weekend students, some of whom were just walking by, have grabbed brushes, climbed the scaffold, and painted. Between brush strokes many have been moved to discuss and share thoughts on the theme behind the images.<br/>
<br/>
 Gilon is a New York-based community mural artist who has helped organize similar murals at more than a dozen college campuses around the country and overseas. The theme "Building Understanding: Painting Narratives of the Middle East" is designed to bring together people with diverse perspectives, experiences, and curiosities.<br/>
<br/>
 Gilon holds U.S. and Israeli citizenship, which influences her artwork and teaching techniques.&#160; She was born in Boston, lived for many years in Israel, and is married to an Israeli.<br/>
<br/>
 "It&#8217;s a collaborative effort, students walk by and get involved," said Nouran Hashimi, a third year psychology major at Merrill College.&#160; "It's a good space to talk about these things," she said, referring to conflict in the Middle East.<br/>
<br/>
 Hashimi, who is half Iranian and half Iraqi, is depicted in the design, as are other students. "It facilitates interactions among people who might not normally talk. While you're painting you talk about the conflict," she said.<br/>
<br/>
 "I was trying to think of different ways to encourage dialog," said Colleges Nine and Ten Provost Helen Shapiro. "We wanted a new format to engage the students."<br/>
<br/>
 Shapiro said she had heard of Gilon's work at other institutions and contacted her.&#160; The mural and the issues behind it fit well with the College Nine and Ten academic themes, she said;Global and International Perspectives for Nine, and Social Justice and Community for Ten.<br/>
<br/>
 Ben Gevercer graduated from College Nine in March with a degree in Global Economics, and is teaching a College Nine course this quarter: "Israel and Palestine: Pathways to a Deeper Understanding." He's been working on the mural as have his students.<br/>
<br/>
 For a month, students were involved in a virtual discussion and dialog via Flickr and Facebook pages on what the mural should be. Gilon arrived a week ago to assist in pulling the design together from the many images and ideas submitted.<br/>
<br/>
 Besides universities such as MIT, Wellesley, Brandeis, and now UCSC, Gilon has also facilitated similar projects at an Arab Jewish culture center in Haifa, Israel and at the University of Haifa.&#160; She hopes to complete another project this summer at a Muslim and Jewish conference in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia.<br/>
<br/>
 "One thing that is really exciting is listening to each student and how they identify with the symbols on the wall," she said of her first visit to UCSC and Santa Cruz.<br/>
<br/>
 "I love it. I'm thinking of moving here."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="99adab058072704601ee33fd742ca1a2"><name>course-evaluation</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>eCommons Online Course Evaluations for Spring Quarter</title><summary>Students, we encourage you to evaluate your courses using this system.</summary><start-date>1337932800000</start-date><display-name>Online Course Evaluations for Spring Quarter</display-name><path>/2012/05/course-evaluation</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/05/course-evaluation</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1338313124496</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1338313124496</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Within the next few days many of you will receive emails about participating in the Spring quarter Online Course Evaluation (OCE) process. We encourage you to evaluate your courses using this system. Student evaluations are an integral component in the faculty tenure review process. Additionally, evaluations help faculty gauge ways in which their instruction or the course material could be improved. In short, your opinions matter and are taken seriously. We want to assure you that this information is confidential and your identity is not connected to the data.<br/>
<br/>
 As we continue to update and modify the system, one component that we have not yet been able to change concerns the reminder messaging component. We understand that receiving multiple reminder messages can be frustrating. At the present time the frequency is controlled at the department/college level, and we have asked participating units to use discretion when issuing reminders. Know that it is our goal to consolidate the reminder messages in a future roll-out of the system.<br/>
<br/>
 Departments and colleges have been instructed to issue the evaluations from Tuesday, May 29 through Sunday, June 10. While the start date may vary, the last day to evaluate a course is Sunday, June 10, which is the day before finals begin. All course evaluations should be received no later than that date.<br/>

<p>The UC Office of the President is proposing a renewal of the ERIT program to support campus needs related to the ongoing budget shortfall. The proposed renewal of the program allows career staff, except members of the Senior Management Group (SMG), to voluntarily reduce their time.</p>
<p>Subject to department approval, eligible employees could choose to participate in the program for one month or more beginning July 1, 2012, through June 30, 2014, and voluntarily reduce their pay and hours worked between 5 and 50 percent of full time.</p>
<p>In return for a voluntary reduction in time, participants will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accrue vacation and sick leave credits at their rate accrued prior to participation in ERIT;</li>
<li>Continue their UC health and welfare benefits without changes to premiums or benefits while participating in ERIT;</li>
<li>Have their UC Retirement Plan (UCRP) contributions based on their reduced salary, and UCRP service credit will accrue based on their reduced appointment;</li>
<li>Have other retirement benefits calculated based upon their pre-ERIT compensation rate as outlined within the proposed program guidelines.</li>
</ul>
<p>Represented employee's participation in ERIT will be subject to collective bargaining.</p>

<p>Lee will be an inaugural member of UC's LGBT Task Force, which has been asked to follow up on the work started by members of Yudof's Advisory Council on Campus Climate, Culture, and Inclusion. "The creation of this task force will allow for a more complete examination of the recommendations and challenges identified by the [LGBT] work group, including the development of priorities, planning strategies, and expected resource requirements," Yudof wrote in appointing Lee.</p>
<p>The UC task force is expected to convene for the first time in July, at which time members will finalize the group's charge, timeline, and work plan. The task force's initial work is expected to be completed within 18 to 24 months.</p>
<p>"I am confident that together we will do all we can to make our campuses more welcoming and inclusive environments for LBGT students, faculty, and staff, as well as for all communities at UC," Yudof said.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page

expand</strong> its programming and partnerships in the community, Shakespeare Santa Cruz (SSC) will collaborate with <strong>Jewel Theater Company</strong> in spring 2013 to co-produce two one-act plays by Harold Pinter.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
A double bill--featuring <strong>One for the Road</strong>, directed by SSC artistic director Marco Barricelli, and <strong>The Lover</strong>, directed by Jewel Theatre artistic director Julie James&#8212;will run April 25 through May 12, 2013, at the Center Stage in downtown Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are excited to partner with Julie James and Jewel Theatre Company,&#8221; noted SSC Managing Director Kyle Clausen. &#8220;Expanding our programming into the spring and exploring fruitful co-producing relationships are two of the goals for the growth of our organization.&#8221;</p>
<p>Barricelli added, &#8220;We also seek, as an organization, to program more works by the best contemporary playwrights, and Harold Pinter is at the top of that list for me.&#8221;<br/>
&#160;<br/>
<strong>Shakespeare Santa Cruz also announced</strong> that its annual holiday show will return in 2012, with <strong>Honk!,</strong> a musical re-telling of <em>The Ugly Duckling</em> by Hans Christian Andersen.<br/>
<br/>
Written by Anthony Drewe (book and lyrics) and George Stiles (music), <em>Honk!</em> played London&#8217;s West End in 1999, where it was honored with an Olivier Award for Best Musical in 2000.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Honk!</em> will be the 14th holiday co-production by SSC and the UCSC Theater Arts Department since the annual tradition began in 1997.<br/>
<br/>
The collaboration provides opportunities for advanced students in Theater Arts to gain valuable experience working alongside top professionals in the theater world.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;For most of the students involved in this collaboration, it&#8217;s their first opportunity to work in a professional setting,&#8221; noted Theater Arts Department Chair David Lee Cuthbert.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;It&#8217;s a great environment to apply the lessons learned in the classroom,&#8221; he added.<br/>
<br/>
<em>Honk!</em> will play at UCSC November 16 through December 9, and will include four special weekday matinee performances for local school groups.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>SSC&#8217;s third annual fall benefit show</strong>--supporting the company&#8217;s education and internship programs--is now set for one performance only on Sunday, October 14, at 2 p.m. in the UCSC Mainstage Theater.<br/>
<br/>
The featured play will be <strong>In Acting Shakespeare</strong>, writer and performer James DeVita&#8217;s personal adaptation of Sir Ian McKellan&#8217;s one-man show that toured the U.S. in 1987.<br/>
<br/>
DeVita is a leading actor and director at the acclaimed American Players Theatre in Spring Green, Wisconsin, and his roles have included Iago, Macbeth, Hamlet, and Richard III.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
He is also the resident playwright at First Stage Children&#8217;s Theatre in Milwaukee, and an award-winning author.&#160;<br/>
<br/>
&#160;&#8220;James DeVita is one of the most accomplished artists in the American Theatre, and I&#8217;m thrilled to be bringing his personal take on Shakespeare to Santa Cruz,&#8221; Barricelli noted.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;These three productions represent SSC continuing beloved traditions and also venturing into uncharted territories,&#8221; Barricelli added. &#8220;I&#8217;m excited to be announcing productions beyond the current season, which reflects the long-term planning happening within our organization.&#8221;<br/>

The UCSC team developed a photoactive compound that releases nitric oxide when exposed to light, and loaded it into a porous, biocompatible material that could be applied as a sprayable powder.</p>
<p>In laboratory tests, the light-triggered nitric oxide treatment eradicated a highly drug-resistant strain of <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em>, a type of gram-negative bacteria that causes hard-to-treat and potentially lethal infections throughout the world, including serious infections in soldiers wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan. The team led by Pradip Mascharak, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC Santa Cruz, and graduate student Brandon Heilman published their results in the <em>Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS)</em>. The <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja3022736">paper</a> is currently available online and will be featured on the cover of a future print issue of the journal.</p>
<p>Nitric oxide has potent antimicrobial effects and is known to play a role in the immune system and promote wound healing. Gaseous nitric oxide has been used to treat infected wounds, but handling the toxic and reactive gas poses many challenges. So researchers have begun exploring a variety of other methods for delivering nitric oxide as an antibiotic treatment. Because nitric oxide attacks a large number of targets in microorganisms, including DNA, proteins, and lipids, many scientists expect bacteria will not easily develop resistance to it.</p>
<p>Mascharak's lab developed a photoactive manganese nitrosyl, a compound that rapidly releases nitric oxide when exposed to light. As a carrier for this compound, the researchers used a porous silicate material known as MCM-41, which traps the photoactive compound inside its pores. They also tested a related aluminosilicate material (Al-MCM-41), which holds the photoactive compound even more tightly. Tests showed that after the light-triggered release of nitric oxide, the byproduct of the reaction remains trapped inside the powdery, biocompatible material.</p>
<p>"It only delivers nitric oxide. The rest remains trapped in the material, which can be washed out of the wound," Mascharak said. "We think it could be used as a sprayable powder for treating battlefield wounds."</p>
<p><em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em> has earned the nickname "Iraqibacter" because it has caused so many serious infections in soldiers wounded in Iraq. Some strains of the bacteria are resistant to virtually all antibiotics. Mascharak's lab tested their compound against a strain, isolated from a soldier injured in Afghanistan, that showed resistance to nine of 11 antibiotics tested.</p>
<p>To test the photoactive compound, the researchers developed a laboratory model of skin and soft-tissue infections. A standard antibacterial assay involves growing bacteria on the surface of an agar plate (a petri dish with a layer of firm, gelatin-like growth medium). In an infection, however, bacteria are not only on the surface but also deeper within the skin or soft tissues. "We realized that there wasn't a good model for in vitro testing of antibiotics against soft-tissue infections," Heilman said.</p>
<p>To more closely mimic the conditions in an infected wound, Heilman mixed bacteria into a warm solution of "soft brine agar" and poured that onto agar plates to solidify. The bacteria then grew throughout a 1.1-millimeter-thick layer of soft agar, allowing growth and colonization to occur in a manner similar to that seen in skin and soft-tissue infections.</p>
<p>Heilman then applied the aluminosilicate powder, with and without the photoactive manganese nitrosyl compound, to a defined area of the plates before shining visible light on them. The released nitric oxide effectively cleared the bacteria from the treated areas of the plates, showing that the nitric oxide easily penetrated through the agar layer. The amount of light used to activate the compound (100 milliWatts per square centimeter) is a typical light flux on a sunny day, Mascharak said.</p>
<p>The ability to control the release of nitric oxide using light is a significant advantage for clinical applications, he added. Tests showed that illumination of the material causes a steady release of nitric oxide, which can be stopped and started repeatedly by turning the light off and on. In the field, this could be accomplished by covering and uncovering the treated area.</p>
<p>"This is the first proof-of-concept to show that it works," Mascharak said. In the paper, the researchers concluded that "It is expected that application of these nitrosyl-containing porous materials to infected wounds followed by exposure to sunlight will bring about a rapid reduction of the pathogen load."</p>
<p>The researchers now hope to find collaborators who can help them with the next levels of testing needed to develop the clinical potential of their compound.</p>
<p>In addition to Heilman and Mascharak, the coauthors of the paper include Jessica St. John, a UCSC graduate student, and Scott Oliver, associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry, who helped with the characterization of the materials. This research was supported by the National Science Foundation and the California Institute for Quantitative Bioscience (QB3).</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9ea5a8388072704600ead36ffb8d2e7f"><name>academic-recruitment-system</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Academic Recruitment System Goes Online June 1 </title><summary>The Academic Personnel Office is pleased to announce the launch of UCSC Academic Recruit, an online application system designed to improve support for the recruitment of world-class academics to UC Santa Cruz. </summary><start-date>1338364800000</start-date><display-name>Academic Recruitment System Goes Online </display-name><path>/2012/05/academic-recruitment-system</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2012/05/academic-recruitment-system</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1338396485574</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1338396485574</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>The Academic Personnel Office is pleased to announce the launch of UCSC Academic Recruit, an online application system designed to improve support for the recruitment of world-class academics to UC Santa Cruz. <br/>
<br/>
UCSC Academic Recruit allows for direct electronic submission of materials by applicants, as well as secure online review by academic search committees. This will facilitate the recruitment review process and significantly reduce the current staff workload associated with receipt and management of applicant materials. The system is part of the larger UC Recruit application system being deployed throughout the UC system as a 'Working Smarter' initiative. <br/>
<br/>
The Recruit system will be available for new Senate faculty recruitments as of June 1, 2012. Other academic recruitments will be added to the system later in 2012-13. Hands-on training will be provided for hiring units.

<p>Also called M31, the Andromeda galaxy is the closest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way and the largest in the local group of galaxies. Painstaking measurements of its motion show that it will collide with the Milky Way about 4 billion years from now. M31 is now 2.5 million light-years away, but inexorably drifting ever nearer to us under the mutual pull of gravity between the two galaxies.</p>
<p>Puragra Guhathakurta, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, said astronomers have long speculated that the two galaxies would eventually collide. "Now we've shown that a collision is inevitable," he said.</p>
<p>The Hubble observations are reported in a paper to be published in the <em>Astrophysical Journal.</em> Guhathakurta, who has been studying the Andromeda galaxy for 15 years, is a coauthor of the paper. He helped plan the study with Roeland van der Marel of the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), who led the investigation. In order to measure the motion of Andromeda's center of mass with respect to the Milky Way, it was necessary to correct for how Andromeda's stars are moving within the galaxy. To do this, the team used data and models developed by the <a href="http://research.pbsci.ucsc.edu/astro/splash">SPLASH</a> collaboration led by Guhathakurta.</p>
<p>The Milky Way is destined to get a major makeover during the encounter with Andromeda, but our solar system is in no danger of being destroyed. Computer simulations derived from Hubble's data show that it will take another 2 billion years for the interacting galaxies to completely merge together under the tug of gravity, reshaping them into a single elliptical galaxy.</p>
<p>Although the galaxies will plow into each other, stars inside each galaxy are so far apart that they will not collide with other stars during the encounter. However, the stars will be thrown into different orbits around the new galactic center. Simulations show that our solar system will probably be tossed much farther from the galactic core than it is today.</p>
<p>To make matters more complicated, M31's small companion, the Triangulum galaxy (M33), will join in the collision and perhaps later merge with the M31/Milky Way pair. There is a small chance that M33 will hit the Milky Way first.</p>
<p>It has long been known that M31 is moving toward the Milky Way at about a 250,000 miles per hour. This measurement was made using the Doppler effect to measure how starlight from the galaxy has been compressed by Andromeda's motion toward us. It had remained uncertain, however, whether the far-future encounter would be a near miss, a glancing blow, or a head-on smashup. This depends on how much sideways or tangential motion M31 has. Until now, astronomers have not been able to measure M31's sideways motion on the sky, despite attempts dating back more than a century.</p>
<p>The Hubble team led by van der Marel conducted extraordinarily precise observations of M31 that remove any doubt that it is destined to collide and merge with the Milky Way. This was accomplished by repeatedly observing select regions of the galaxy over a five- to seven-year period. Two related papers published together with the new observations include one describing the measurement technique and another presenting the results of computer simulations that show the consequences of the galactic merger.</p>
<p>In a computer simulation in which M31 slams into the Milky Way head-on, the stars are all scattered into different orbits. The stellar populations of both galaxies are jostled, and the Milky Way loses its flattened pancake shape. The galaxies' cores merge, and the stars settle into randomized orbits to create an elliptical-shaped galaxy.</p>
<p>The science team that did the investigation is led by van der Marel (STScI) and includes S.T. Sohn and J. Anderson (STScI), G. Besla (Columbia University), M. Fardal (University of Massachusetts, Amherst), R.L. Beaton (University of Virginia, Charlottesville), Thomas M. Brown (STScI), P. Guhathakurta (UC Santa Cruz), and T.J. Cox (Carnegie Observatories).</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/science/milky-way-collide.html </url><title>NASA news release, images, and video</title></related-links><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://hubblesite.org/news/2012/20 </url><title>Hubble news release, images, and video</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="a4b7b0668072704601e07354bdf58ea2"><name>dana-frank-nation</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UCSC History Professor contributes cover story to The Nation magazine</title><summary>The June 11 issue of The Nation magazine features a cover story by UC Santa Cruz history professor Dana Frank.&#13;

<br/>
Titled <em>Honduras: Which Side is the U.S. On?</em>, the article examines the impact of the 2009 military coup in Honduras and U.S. policy supporting the new regime&#8212;describing a corrupt drug war that has been used as the pretext for increased U.S. militarization of the area.<br/>
<br/>
"I've been researching Honduras for over 10 years now, and it's horrifying to follow the ways it's descended deeper and deeper into a terrifying human rights abyss since the June 28, 2009 military coup that overthrew democratically-elected President Manuel Zelaya,&#8221; notes Frank.<br/>
&#160;<br/>
"Following the Honduran news daily is hard to take: constant murders, a thoroughly corrupt government, and a completely nonfunctional judicial system,&#8221; she adds.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>One of the top academic experts</strong> on Honduras in the United States, Frank has been commenting on the volatile situation in the region for media ranging from <em>National Public Radio</em>, to the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>, to the <em>Associated Press</em>.<br/>
<br/>
The <em>New York Times</em> published her most recent op-ed&#8212;titled <em>In Honduras, a Mess Made in the U.S.</em>&#8212;on January 27.<br/>
<br/>
"It's a tremendous responsibility to be one of the people that tracks the spectacular human rights abuses that are going on in Honduras, many of them perpetrated by the ongoing coup government itself--which it even admits,&#8221; says Frank.<br/>
<br/>
&#8220;The U.S. mainstream media has largely ignored the horror of what's going on down there, and even celebrated the escalation of the U.S. military in Honduras, in the name of &#8216;fighting drug trafficking&#8217;,&#8221; she adds.</p>
<p><strong>For the past three years</strong>, Frank has been communicating with the media, as well as members of Congress about U.S. policy in the region. She has contributed additional op-ed pieces about the ramifications of the coup to such media outlets as the <em>Huffington Post</em> and the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>Frank concludes her article</strong> in <em>The Nation</em> by noting:<br/>
<br/>
<em>&#8220;Alas, we&#8217;re in the 1980s all over again, when the United States under President Ronald Reagan favored right-wing governments over democracy movements in Latin America. The implications of the Honduran coup&#8217;s success are ominous.</em><br/>
<br/>
<em>As Tirza Flores Lanza&#8212;a former appeals court magistrate in San Pedro Sula, who was fired with four other judges and magistrates for opposing the coup&#8212;put it: &#8220;The coup d&#8217;&#233;tat in Honduras destroyed the incipient democracy that, with great effort, we were constructing, and revived the specter of military dictatorships that are now once again ready to pounce throughout Latin America.&#8221;</em><br/>

<p>UCSC ranked first in the world in the key citation index (30 percent of the final score) that measures the influence of an institution's research.</p>
<p>"I am delighted that UCSC's world-class research and teaching have been recognized by the <em>Times Higher Education's</em> authoritative analysis," said Chancellor George Blumenthal. "It proves what I've often said, UC Santa Cruz continues on an upward trajectory."</p>
<p>Bruce Margon, UCSC vice chancellor for research, said, "The international prominence of our faculty's research, as evidenced by the remarkable first place score in the citations category, presents amazing opportunities for our students, who can learn not just from textbooks, but in person from the researchers who are actually making the discoveries that are recognized worldwide."</p>
<p>UCSC and UC Irvine, both founded in 1965,&#160; were the only American universities to rank in the top 10. Irvine was fourth. Pohang University of Science and Technology in South Korea was ranked first.</p>
<p>In an <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2012/06/01/ED1E1OQ7R7.DTL">opinion piece published Friday</a> in the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>, Blumenthal notes that while other governments are investing in higher education the U.S. is slashing spending on public education. " We cannot afford to let our public universities languish as China, India and European countries invest lavishly in theirs," Blumenthal wrote.</p>
<p>The "100 Under 50" aims to show which nations are challenging the U.S. and the United Kingdom as higher education powerhouses &#8211; and offers insights into which institutions may be future world leaders. Six East Asian universities were in the top 20.<br/>
<br/>
<em>THE</em> used the <a href=" http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=420090">same range of 13 performance indicators</a> to rank institutions for the "100 under 50" as it used for its <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/">World University Rankings</a> published in the fall, a list on which UCSC ranked 110. There, UCSC ranked third in the world for research influence.</p>
<p><em>THE</em> said it reduced the weight on subjective indicators for academic prestige for the younger universities, reasoning that older universities have more time to build up a reputation with deeper, wider, and more established alumni networks.<br/>
<br/>
"It was agreed that an analysis of younger institutions, designed to examine future potential as much as current excellence and to move away from heritage or legacy, should be based more on hard, objective performance indicators," <em>THE</em> wrote in its analysis.<br/>
<br/>
The weighting given to reputation has been reduced from a third in the World University Rankings to just over a fifth in the "100 Under 50" list.<br/>
<br/>
The principal criteria <em>THE</em> used are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research: volume, income and reputation (30 percent);</li>
<li>Citations: research influence; (30 percent);</li>
<li>Teaching: the learning environment (30 percent)</li>
<li>International outlook: people and research (7.5 percent);</li>
<li>Industry income: innovation (2.5 percent)</li>

The revised policy applies to staff and non-academic student employees, volunteers, and&#160;managers/supervisors of these individuals.<br/>
 <br/>
 <strong>Current Background Check Policy</strong><br/>
 <br/>
 UC Policy PPSM 21.E - Appointment requires review of job-related background information&#160;on final candidates for critical positions and employees who are promoted, reclassified, or&#160;transferred into critical positions. A critical position is a position which meets at least one of&#160;the critical criteria (e.g., cash handling, master key access) outlined in the UC System-wide&#160;Guidelines, located at:<br/>
 <br/>
 <a href="http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/employees/policies_employee_labor_relations/personnel_policies/spp21e.html" target="_blank">http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/employees/policies_employee_labor_relations/personnel_policies/spp21e.html</a><br/>
 <br/>
 Background checks may include, but are not necessarily limited to, a review of a candidate or&#160;appointee&#8217;s criminal history information, DMV records review, and/or verification of license,&#160;certificate or degree.<br/>
 <br/>
 UCSC local policy currently requires background checks for:<br/>
 
<ul>
<li>Initial hire or rehire into a staff critical position;</li>
<li>Transfer/promotion/demotion or reclassification from a non-critical staff position into a&#160;critical staff position;</li>
<li>Inter-location transfer into a staff critical position;</li>
<li>Student employees in critical positions; and</li>
<li>Volunteers assigned critical duties.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<div>The Manager/Supervisor is currently delegated the authority to designate a position as critical&#160;and to make the final decision regarding suitability of employment when criminal history exists.<br/>
<br/>
 <strong>Proposed Changes</strong><br/>
 
<ul>
<li>Delegate the authority to designate a staff or student position as critical to Staff Human&#160;Resources.</li>
<li>Establish a Criminal History Review Committee with delegated authority to determine&#160;suitability of employment when conviction history is revealed via the formal background&#160;check process. The committee would be comprised of the AVC for Staff Human Resources,&#160;the Campus Controller, and the AVC for Safety and Risk Services. An applicant&#8217;s&#160;falsification or failure to disclose information would be addressed by the committee as well.</li>
<li>Require initiation of new hire and rehire criminal history background checks to occur no later&#160;than 5 business days after hire date.</li>
<li>Require that current UC employees complete their criminal history background check prior&#160;to the effective date of the personnel action (e.g., transfer, promotion).</li>
</ul>

 Policy-covered employees who wish to provide comments on the revised policy may submit&#160;them to Lori Castro at <a href="mailto:lhcastro@ucsc.edu" target="_blank">lhcastro@ucsc.edu</a> by July 1st, 2012.<br/>
<br/>
 Proposed policy changes would apply to positions covered by a collective bargaining agreement.&#160;For employees covered by collective bargaining agreements, notice has been given to your&#160;exclusive representative, who has been invited to submit comments on your behalf. Please direct&#160;your comments to your union representative for consideration.

<p>Under this policy, the University compensates eligible employees for the difference between their University base pay and military pay and allowances until the end of the employee&#8217;s tour of active military duty, until June 30, 2014, or until their separation date of University appointment, whichever comes first. The University also continues to pay the UC contribution to employee&#8217;s health premiums while an employee is eligible for benefits under the policy. Benefits provided under the policy are subject to a two-year lifetime limit.</p>
<p>Employees not eligible for supplemental pay because their military pay and allowances exceed their University wages may elect to continue their health plan coverage while on military leave and the University will continue to pay the UC contribution to those plans if the employee continues to make the employee contribution.</p>
<p>Eligible employees under this policy are those who serve on active military duty in the War on Terror campaign.</p>
<p>It is the University&#8217;s desire to assist, to the extent possible, employees who are called to active duty during this campaign. Therefore, the University has proposed that the Policy be renewed for a two-year period, effective July 1, 2012 through June 30, 2014.</p>
<p>Revised Implementation Guidelines and Extended Military Leave Q&amp;A&#8217;s reflecting the proposed two-year extension are posted at the following URL:</p>

<p>Academic employees should direct their comments to Laura Zellman at <a href="mailto:lzellman@ucsc.edu">lzellman@ucsc.edu</a> and staff employees should direct their comments to Cathy Schoenfeld at <a href="mailto:pafc@ucsc.edu">pafc@ucsc.edu</a> by June 20, 2012.</p>
