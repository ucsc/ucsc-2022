(Photo by Melissa De Witte)</image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Leila Takayama is an expert on robots, yet she's the first to admit that she has a complicated relationship with these technological marvels.</p>
<p>She's happy to have them vacuum and mow the lawn, but she gets nervous in a friend's Tesla when he puts it on auto pilot.</p>
<p>Takayama knows better than almost anyone how integrated robots have become in our lives&#8212;which also makes her an expert on their shortcomings. Yet her excitement about their potential to enhance human relationships is contagious. Such is the paradox of being a leading researcher in the field of human-robot interaction.</p>
<p>"I&#8217;m interested in building robots that interact with people, that do things for people in their day-to-day lives, not just in factories and on battlefields," said Takayama, an acting associate professor of psychology who joined the faculty last fall. "People are intimidated by robots, but that goes away when they interact with them. We quickly fall into talking to them like they're alive, like they're our partners, or pets. That's key to my work, which is all about making robots easier to live and work with."</p>
<p>Robots have already transformed manufacturing, and they are regular fixtures in hospital operating rooms, search and rescue operations, deep-sea exploration, and bomb disposal. Takayama's work focuses on improving the design and function of personal robots to make them more appealing to humans, expanding what they can do for us.</p>
<p>Professional designers and human-computer interaction researchers like Takayama are making robots more approachable. "We&#8217;ve learned from the lessons of developing personal computers, that we can make these seemingly complicated systems more user-friendly," she said.</p>
<p>Takayama specializes in robots with "telepresence"&#8212;machines outfitted with video and telecommunications gear that are fully or partially controlled by people. They range from the size of a toy poodle to an adult human, but Takayama's favorite model is about four feet tall and looks a bit like an iPad on a rolling vertical stand; it retails for about $1,500.</p>
<p>Operated remotely by a human, these robots allow operators to "beam in" and connect with people remotely. In the workplace, these robots are a vast improvement over teleconferencing, because they literally enable colleagues to "take a place at the table" during meetings. Afterwards, remote colleagues can roll down the hall and remain part of the conversation, or linger to be part of the post-meeting debrief.</p>
<p>"In an ideal world, you forget there's a robot there," she said. "I want them to disappear the same way telephones have disappeared. When I&#8217;m talking with my grandma on the phone, I&#8217;m just talking with my grandma. I&#8217;m not thinking about the complex devices and networks that are enabling us to have that long-distance conversation."</p>
<p>Takayama's current research involves interviewing people who use robots to learn what they like, what they don't like&#8212;and what they really hate. Those shortcomings are what get robots "hijacked," or shut off. In hospitals, robots may do a good job of delivering towels and charts, but if they can't get out of the way of nurses as they hustle down hallways, the nurses will pull the plug.</p>
<p>"My goal is to make robots fade into the background of our everyday experiences," said Takayama. "I want them to become so quietly useful that they become unremarkable."</p>
<p>Takayama is excited about bringing robots into assisted living facilities to enable distant family members to virtually "visit" elderly relatives. Surveying older adults who pilot-tested the technology, she was struck by how readily they embraced it&#8212;and by how strongly they want to be able to control the timing and frequency of visits. "They don't want their kids just showing up unannounced!" she said. They also want to be able to visit with friends&#8212;and to reverse roles, "driving" the robots so they can "get out" to museums, ballparks, concerts, and other places they can no longer get to on their own.</p>
<p>"Like most other technology, robots need to bring value to our lives," said Takayama. "I'm not going to charge my phone every night, if it doesn't provide value to me the next day. Robots need to be useful."</p>
<p>They also need better social skills&#8212;basic things like not "standing" right smack in the middle of an elevator. "I mean, come on, that's just annoying!" she said. "At Stanford Hospital, they've had to post signs that basically say 'If there's a robot in this elevator, don't get on.' We've got to be able to do better than that!"</p>
<p>Takayama studied psychology and cognitive science as an undergrad at UC Berkeley, and she earned a Ph.D. in communication from Stanford. She spent eight years in industry before joining UC Santa Cruz, working in open-source robotics for four years and then joining Google X, the company's super-secret "moonshot factory," where she worked on the then-secret drone-delivery project.</p>
<p>"Research is what I love," she said, but her work is highly interdisciplinary, encompassing psychology, computer engineering, and linguistics, so Takayama found the secrecy confining. "I need my research to be out in the open."</p>
<p>She was also sold on the potential of robotics to do more than deliver packages&#8212;and drop bombs. Drones, which Takayama calls "flying weed whackers," have given robots a bad name. "The drone isn&#8217;t the one who decided where, when, or how to drop that bomb on the military target," she said. "A human being operates that drone. It's never been about the robots. The real issues lie in the people surrounding those robots.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the moment, robots remain mired in a public relations quagmire, and not only because they do a poor job of sharing the elevator. The fear persists that robots will displace workers, and science fiction tales of robots taking over the world feed into the narrative that robots have minds of their own.</p>
<p>"People think robots are scary, alienating, but they're not. They're just machines," said Takayama, their greatest advocate. "We invent and build them. We need to feel that we're in control and take responsibility for how we develop them.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/09/images/leila-takayama.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/09/images/leila-takayama.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>leila-takayama.jpg</name><display-name>leila-takayama.jpg</display-name><file-size>12276</file-size><width>295</width><height>147</height></thumb><thumb-alt/><title>LEILA TAKAYAMA</title><description>Leila Takayama is an expert on robots, yet she's the first to admit that she has a complicated relationship with these technological marvels.</description></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3a515771807270176705df1a46a90c06"><name>tmt-workshop</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz hosts international workshop for Thirty Meter Telescope</title><summary>Work on TMT is in high gear at UC Santa Cruz and other partner institutions and countries around the world.</summary><keywords>Lisa Hunter</keywords><start-date>1504249200000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz hosts international workshop for Thirty Meter Telescope</display-name><path>/2017/09/tmt-workshop</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/09/tmt-workshop</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1504216961630</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1504279048304</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Research</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>International</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Diversity</value><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/09/images/tmt-workshop1-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/09/images/tmt-workshop1-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tmt-workshop1-400.jpg</name><display-name>tmt-workshop1-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>88459</file-size><width>400</width><height>267</height></image><image-alt>workshop participants</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/09/images/tmt-workshop1-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/09/images/tmt-workshop1-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>tmt-workshop1-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>tmt-workshop1-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>31922</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>workshop participants</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>The TMT Future Leaders Workshop brought together graduate students and postdocs from Canada, China, India, Japan, UC, and Caltech.

<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Workshop participants, representing all of the TMT International Observatory's partners (Canada, China, India, Japan, UC, and Caltech), worked on projects in small teams, visited astronomical laboratory facilities, toured </span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><a href="http://ucolick.org/main/index.html"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Lick Observatory</span></a></u></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">, and met with numerous scientists and engineers involved in TMT. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">At a symposium on August 25, TMT project manager Gary Sanders gave the group an overview of the work now under way around the globe as progress on TMT moves through the final design and production phases for various components of the telescope and its instruments. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"We're very far along. A lot of work is going on globally in a big and powerful international collaboration," Sanders said.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The TMT Future Leaders Workshop was organized and led by the </span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><a href="https://isee.ucsc.edu/"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Institute for Scientist &amp; Engineer Educators (ISEE)</span></a></u></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;"> at UC Santa Cruz. ISEE director Lisa Hunter said the workshop emphasized international collaboration and provided many opportunities for participants to apply what they learned by working in teams to propose solutions to problems currently being tackled by TMT. The intention is to train TMT's future scientific and technical leaders.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"We want to prepare these early-career scientists and engineers to do team science in cross-cultural collaborations," Hunter said. "There are huge challenges in coordinating a large international project like TMT, and we hope this workshop will help stimulate collaborations across the partnership."</span></p>
<p class="western"><strong><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Workforce development</span></strong></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">ISEE has a long history of working with major telescopes on education and workforce development programs. The institute got its start as part of the Center for Adaptive Optics at UC Santa Cruz and has been working with telescopes in Hawaii since 2002 and with TMT since 2009. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">In Hawaii, ISEE is best known for the </span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><a href="https://akamaihawaii.org/"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Akamai Workforce Initiative</span></a></u></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">, which provides internships, mentoring, and support for college students in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. Telescopes face special challenges in creating a local workforce due to their remote sites and need for highly trained workers. Akamai prepares local college students for jobs in telescope operations and contributes to the regional workforce by supporting students across a broad range of STEM fields. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">TMT is currently the major funder of the Akamai program, which has provided more than 350 internships to students from Hawaii. More than a quarter of the participants are native Hawaiian, and more than 140 Akamai alumni are now working in scientific and technical jobs in Hawaii. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Maunakea in Hawaii was chosen in 2009 as the preferred site to build and operate TMT, but in 2015</span> <span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">the Hawaii Supreme Court ruled that the state&#8217;s permitting process&#160;</span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">was flawed. While proceedings to re-obtain the required permit move forward in Hawaii, TMT has also investigated alternative sites and last year chose a site in La Palma, on the Canary Islands, as the alternate site for TMT.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"We are working on two options," Sanders said. "Maunakea is still the preferred site, but we are also working hard in the Canary Islands. Meanwhile, most of the project continues to move forward."</span></p>
<p class="western"><strong><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">&#65279;New opportunities</span></strong></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">When completed, TMT will provide new observational opportunities in essentially every field of astronomy and astrophysics. Its 30-meter primary mirror, composed of 492 hexagonal segments, will have nine times the light-collecting area of today's largest optical telescopes, allowing TMT to reach further and see more clearly than previous telescopes by a factor of 10 to 100 depending on the observation.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The segmented-mirror design, pioneered on the 10-meter </span><span color="#0000ff" style="color: #0000ff;"><u><a href="http://www.keckobservatory.org/"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Keck telescopes</span></a></u></span><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">, was conceived by the late Jerry Nelson, a professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz and TMT project scientist, who died in June. Sanders paid homage to Nelson at the symposium, as did UCSC Chancellor George Blumenthal in his opening remarks.</span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">"His work empowered astronomers throughout the UC system and helped put us where we are today," Blumenthal said. </span></p>
<p class="western"><span face="Arial, serif" style="font-family: Arial, serif;">The light collected by TMT's enormous primary mirror will be directed to a sophisticated adaptive optics system and a powerful suite of scientific instruments located around the telescope. The three "first-light" instruments to be deployed when the telescope begins operations&#8212;two infrared spectrometers and one optical spectrometer&#8212;will provide unparalleled science and imaging capabilities.

For more than two decades, the museum has been a living laboratory for developmental psychologist Maureen Callanan, whose work focuses on understanding how children learn to think about the world around them.<br/><br/>"Unlike what the field of developmental psychology assumed for years, children don't all just think one way," said Callanan, a professor of psychology at UC Santa Cruz. "Children are learning different ways to think depending on the family, community, and culture they're growing up in." <br/><br/>Callanan's research focuses on the "why" questions children ask and how children learn to explain causes and effects, and she is committed to learning about children in the social and cultural contexts where they grow up. <br/><br/>That's what makes Children's Discovery Museum a perfect partner. Children from diverse racial, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds visit the museum, and museum administrators are eager to team up with Callanan to learn more about how the learning process unfolds in children. <br/><br/>Callanan just <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cdev.12886/full">published</a> the results of a recent study based on the museum's <em>Mammoth Discovery!</em> exhibit. In the current issue of <em>Child Development</em>, in a special section devoted to research in the "real world," Callanan reports that the ways parents talked with their children about the exhibit was linked to the level of children's engagement&#8212;in ways that may be surprising.<br/><br/>Explaining science to children isn't as engaging as making connections to a child's personal experience, said Callanan.<br/><br/>"A lot of parents made the connection with the movie <em>Ice Age</em>, asking their children if they remembered the mammoth in <em>Ice Age</em>," said Callanan. "Another parent pointed out that the mammoth fossils in the exhibit were discovered 'near where Daddy works.' "<br/><br/>Engagement is key to learning, and the children whose parents made those types of connections were more involved with the exhibit, as measured by the questions they asked and the observations they shared on their own. <br/><br/>Callanan's findings are based on observation, and she is careful to clarify that her results establish correlation not cause. Still, this study, coauthored with graduate student Claudia Casta<span>&#241;</span>eda, research associate Megan Luce of Stanford University, and Jennifer Martin, director of education and programs at Children's Discovery Museum of San Jose, adds to what Callanan has learned about child development over more than 20 years. <br/><br/>"Parents often worry that they don't understand the science, and museum exhibit designers worry about that, too&#8212;that parents might give children the wrong information," said Callanan. "But giving children scientific explanations isn't necessarily the best way to support children&#8217;s engagement with ideas." <br/><br/>Callanan notes that parents are uniquely qualified to support their children's cognitive development. "Everyday conversations are the building blocks of children's learning," she said. "Parents know their kids best. They can make those meaningful connections. When parents do what comes naturally, that tends to be the best framework for children's learning."<br/><br/><strong>Talking about science</strong> <br/><br/>Callanan and her research team observe children in the "real world" because it is more natural than a laboratory setting. Children's Discovery Museum in downtown San Jose attracts a diverse audience&#8212;although visitors tend to have relatively high incomes and education&#8212;and the "content-rich" environment is perfect for eliciting "why" questions. <br/><br/>This work is more timely than ever, as scientific literacy in the United States has plummeted to alarming levels. There is broad consensus that families and educators need to foster children's interest in science and technology&#8212;so-called STEM fields&#8212;at a young age, but there is far less agreement about the best way to do that. Museums and other places of "informal learning" enrich insights gleaned from school classrooms.<br/><br/>"My goal is to understand more about how parents' strategies for interacting with their children in museums might support children's engagement with science," said Callanan, who has observed tremendous diversity in the ways parents interact with their children around science. "For some children, talking about science in school connects with their everyday experience, but for others, it doesn't," she said. <br/><br/>As a researcher, Callanan is interested in the different habits of thinking and talking that develop in different families. For example, giving evidence for a belief is a natural part of conversation in some families but not others, she said, emphasizing that these habits don&#8217;t necessarily correlate with years of education or science expertise.<br/><br/>Callanan recalls an earlier study in which a father who was an auto mechanic effortlessly incorporated logic and evidence into a conversation with his young child. "Parents who enjoy thinking and mulling things over&#8212;in psychology, we call this personality trait the 'need for cognition'&#8212;are more likely to use certain kinds of talk with their children, and those are the ways of thinking in conversation that the children grow up with," she said. "There's no 'right way' to talk with children, just like there's no one way that all children develop." However, understanding variation in families&#8217; conversational habits gives educators more information about how to introduce STEM topics to young children.<br/><br/><strong>A productive partnership</strong><br/><br/>For museum educators, Callanan's findings have sometimes provided a road map to improve an exhibit. Several years ago, Callanan's team observed strong gender differences in how much time parents and caregivers spent explaining exhibits to boys and girls&#8212;with boys getting the lion's share of the explanation. The museum's designers applied what they learned to the development of their next exhibit, which featured a female protagonist. That gave parents the idea that these activities were interesting for girls as well as boys&#8212;and there was no longer a gender difference. <br/><br/>Another <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10749039.2016.1196493">recent study</a> conducted with graduate student Graciela Solis found that parents of Mexican heritage who had not completed high school talked with their children in ways that appeared to foster greater engagement than did parents of Mexican heritage who had earned at least a high-school diploma. <br/><br/>"They paid more attention to the evidence and were more willing to say when they were uncertain about what they were observing." Callanan explained. "Their children also asked different questions, more conceptual questions about why things were happening and what would happen next." <br/><br/>"We can't assume low-income children, or children whose parents had less formal education, are at risk," she said. "When we look at what those parents do naturally in conversation, their children might be at an advantage."<br/><br/><strong>The big picture</strong><br/><br/>As the editors of the special section of <em>Child Development</em> write, the field of developmental psychology remains "largely defined through WEIRD populations: Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic." The challenge of broadening the scope of what we know by studying all the world's children in "the messiness of the real world" must be met, they write.</p>
<p>Callanan couldn't agree more.</p>
<p>"Too often, developmental psychologists describe culturally specific findings as if they were universal traits," she said. "Understanding and appreciating the diverse ways families from a range of cultures engage in conversations is part of getting a bigger, more accurate, picture of how children learn."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="3f38ecf1807270176705df1ac65bd956"><name>street-smarts</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Campus joining in city’s traffic safety campaign</title><summary>Street Smarts is a public education campaign that intends to improve the roadway behavior of drivers, bicyclists, and pedestrians—everyone who uses Santa Cruz roadways. </summary><start-date>1504249200000</start-date><display-name>Traffic safety</display-name><path>/2017/09/street-smarts</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/09/street-smarts</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1504299247522</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1504299247522</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Hernandez-Jason</name><title></title><phone/><email>shj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/09/images/street-smarts.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/09/images/street-smarts.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>street-smarts.jpg</name><display-name>street-smarts.jpg</display-name><file-size>218743</file-size><width>400</width><height>320</height></image><image-alt>Street Smarts sign</image-alt><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>In an effort to reduce the number of traffic-related crashes and injuries, UC Santa Cruz is supporting the City of Santa Cruz&#8217;s new traffic safety campaign.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.cityofsantacruz.com/government/city-departments/public-works/traffic-engineering/streetsmarts-2766">Street Smarts</a> is a public education campaign that intends to improve the roadway behavior of drivers, bicyclists, and pedestrians&#8212;everyone who uses Santa Cruz roadways. Banners have gone up across town.

<p>&#8220;Our goal is to create a welcoming and supportive campus environment for all of our students,&#8221; said Chancellor George Blumenthal. &#8220;It&#8217;s critical for us to address the challenges our first-gen students face and provide more&#160;opportunities for their success. As a first-gen myself, I understand how difficult the transition can be for incoming and transfer students.&#8221;</p>
<p>Faculty, professional staff and graduate students are invited to participate in the campaign. Those who are the first in their generation to obtain a 4-year college or university degree can <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdBRpIgwLmnniTWW-CjQVvtwDQajvNEO2fZOWVOxXNq96oQhg/viewform">sign up to receive</a> a first-gen college grad t-shirt.</p>
<p>Faculty, professional staff, and graduate students who are not first-generation, but want to support the campaign can <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdBRpIgwLmnniTWW-CjQVvtwDQajvNEO2fZOWVOxXNq96oQhg/viewform">sign up to receive</a> a first-gen supporter button.</p>
<p>The campaign has several events planned in the coming weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Facebook Live Q&amp;A</strong> (4 p.m., Sept. 5): Tune in for a conversation with first-gen faculty, alumni, and undergraduate students, including UC Santa Cruz Professor Rebecca Covarrubias and psychology undergraduate student, Julisa Lopez. Visit <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ucsantacruz">facebook.com/ucsantacruz</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Welcome Week 2017</strong> (Sept 24&#8211;28): Wear your T-shirts and buttons to welcome incoming and returning students!</li>
<li><strong>First-gen Rally at OPERS Fall Fest</strong> (4 p.m., Tuesday, Sept. 26): Join us to officially kick-off the first-gen initiative and hear reflections and stories from Vice Provost for Student Success Jaye Padgett, Professor Rebecca Covarrubias, and others.</li>
<li>Tell your story and use the hashtag <strong>#FirstGenUCSC</strong> on Facebook, Twitter, SnapChat, and Instagram.</li>
</ul>
<p>As part of this new initiative, a website (<a href="firstgen.ucsc.edu">firstgen.ucsc.edu</a>) has been launched and includes resources and profiles of UC Santa Cruz faculty, staff, and graduate students, sharing their stories and offering advice for first-gen students.</p>
<p>Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Marlene Tromp is one person featured. As a first-generation college graduate, Tromp notes she developed a creative resiliency as she worked three jobs to afford college.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had seen people face enormous challenges and pick themselves up, dust off, and carry on,&#8221; Tromp said. &#8220;I had to do that in terms of a whole range of challenges, even intellectual ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>The initiative&#8217;s goals include fostering a campus climate that welcomes first-generation students and helps them succeed, as well as creating opportunities for campus offices to develop ways to better support first-generation students.</p>
<p>"By drawing attention to the shared identities among students, staff, and faculty we send a clear message that we want you here, you belong here, and you will succeed,&#8221; Rebecca Covarrubias, an assistant professor in the psychology department and faculty director for the program.</p>

<p>An accomplished oceanographer, Sullivan graduated from UCSC in 1973 with a bachelor's degree in Earth sciences and earned a Ph.D. in geology at Dalhousie University in Canada. She served as a member of three NASA space shuttle missions and travelled to the East Pacific Rise in the deep-sea submersible Alvin.</p>
<p>Sullivan served as NOAA administrator from March 2014 to January 2017. She had previously served as NOAA's chief scientist, overseeing a research and technology portfolio that included fisheries biology, climate change, satellite instrumentation, and marine biodiversity; as president and CEO of the Center of Science and Industry in Columbus, Ohio, one of the nation's leading science museums; and as the inaugural director of the Battelle Center for Mathematics and Science Education Policy at Ohio State University. She has also served on the National Science Board and as an oceanographer in the U.S. Navy Reserve.</p>
<p>Sullivan's talk, &#8220;From the Sea to the Stars,&#8221; will take place at 7 p.m. on Wednesday, October 11, at the Rio Theatre (1205 Soquel Ave., Santa Cruz). Tickets, which go on sale September 12, are $18 for general admission; $12 for museum members; $40 for gold circle seating. The event is part of the Santa Cruz Museum of Natural History&#8217;s Rio Theater Speaker Series.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date>10-12-2017</end-date></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="53f8856d807270176705df1a7ef98d22"><name>daca-message</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Trump administration action on DACA</title><summary>Together we are deeply saddened by and strongly disagree with the decision by President Trump today to effectively end the DACA program.

<p>Kimberly Lau and Martin Berger, co-chairs of the initiative, have developed a three-year campaign that focuses on faculty education, participation, and leadership.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to create a significant and noticeable shift in the campus culture,&#8221; said Lau, vice chair of the Academic Senate and a professor of literature. &#8220;Faculty must take the lead and demonstrate that sexual violence and sexual harassment have no place here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The campaign is made up of four components: funding for faculty to develop courses on SVSH-related themes; curriculum workshops to brainstorm ways to incorporate SVSH units into existing courses; a faculty reading group to deepen understanding about the nuances and complexities surrounding SVSH; and a student-centered education series for faculty to underscore the stories and perspectives of those who have experienced abuse.</p>
<p>The Beyond Compliance initiative <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2016/03/an-ethic-of-service.html">was launched in 2016</a> to "define concrete mechanisms that administrators and faculty can adopt, above and beyond what is required by law or policy, to advance a culture of service to each other and our students.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since its launch, the campus has revised policies, sought wider community input, and held town halls and community building circles. Beyond Compliance will now work directly on reshaping campus culture in collaboration with other campus experts on the subject, including the Title IX Office, CARE staff and students, student groups, the Women&#8217;s Center, and the many faculty, staff, and students participating on the Beyond Compliance working group and advisory group.</p>
<p>This multi-year effort was made possible through the financial support of Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Marlene Tromp who is committed to changing campus culture and practices.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kim and I are delighted to have CP/EVC Tromp&#8217;s support. Her funding commitments will ensure that we reach a vastly larger audience, as they help us reshape how the campus community thinks about and responds to SVSH,&#8221; said Berger, interim associate vice provost for Academic Affairs and associate campus diversity officer for faculty.</p>
<p>Campus faculty members, with expertise in an array of areas, are well-positioned to offer new courses focused on sexual violence/sexual harassment themes and issues, Berger said. Courses might offer historical or transnational perspectives on consent laws; look at the cultural forces that sustain rape in literature, art, and life; use &#8220;serious games&#8221; approaches to challenging predatory culture and fostering bystander intervention; and much more.</p>
<p>Curriculum workshops, modeled after what is offered by the Sustainability Office, would help interested faculty members think of ways to add a sexual violence/sexual harassment component into existing courses. The syllabus could include a relevant film, novel or scholarly article, for example.</p>
<p>Lau noted that faculty are often extremely moved by student accounts of their personal experiences around sexual violence/sexual harassment. Their accounts are often much more effective in capturing faculty attention and inspiring them to action. The Beyond Compliance group plans to explore developing an education series that focuses on the student experience with the help of a student through the Chancellor&#8217;s Graduate Internship Program and other campus partners.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Beyond Compliance group, in collaboration with the Title IX Office, will design and implement a faculty Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment training program to educate faculty leaders to act as Title IX ambassadors to the campus community, attending events and meetings, and serving as a resource for better understanding Title IX issues and services. The program aims to expand the number of faculty conversant with these important issues.</p>
<p>The Beyond Compliance group will also work with graduate students and the Graduate Division to develop a set of best practices for supporting students whose advisors are either placed on involuntary leave during an investigation or who have been found in violation of UC&#8217;s SVSH policies. Rather than dealing with student issues on a case-by-case basis, the group aims to develop consistent procedures for ensuring that graduate students get the support they require to make timely progress toward their degrees.</p>
<p>Training faculty ambassadors and developing protocols for students whose graduate advisors are placed on leave will begin this year, as will the review of faculty course proposals. The rest of the initiative will launch in fall 2018.</p>
<p>Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Marlene Tromp comes to UC Santa Cruz with a demonstrated commitment to addressing SVSH.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m pleased to support this vital work and want to send a strong message to the campus community that sexual violence and sexual harassment have no place on this campus,&#8221; Tromp said. &#8220;Through strict adherence to UC policy and enhanced educational efforts, we will strive to create a community where people are free to work and pursue their educations unencumbered by threats of sexual violence or sexual harassment.</p>
<p>"This is an ambitious goal for any institution in a world that has often failed to punish such acts, but it is a goal that matters a great deal to both the chancellor and to me.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="598193fc807270176705df1a39611083"><name>alaska-seismic-study</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Geologists to deploy vast array of seismometers along Alaska Peninsula</title><summary>A team of geologists will deploy a vast array of seismometers along the Alaska Peninsula in an experiment they hope will solve long-standing mysteries.</summary><keywords>Susan Schwartz</keywords><start-date>1504767600000</start-date><display-name>Geologists to deploy vast array of seismometers along Alaska Peninsula</display-name><path>/2017/09/alaska-seismic-study</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/09/alaska-seismic-study</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1504740216730</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1504798789444</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Earth Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Gifts and Grants</value><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/09/images/cascadia1-400.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/09/images/cascadia1-400.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cascadia1-400.jpg</name><display-name>cascadia1-400.jpg</display-name><file-size>111885</file-size><width>400</width><height>315</height></image><image-alt>instrument deployment from ship</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/09/images/cascadia1-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/09/images/cascadia1-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cascadia1-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>cascadia1-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>22597</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>instrument deployment from ship</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Ocean-bottom seismometers and other instruments originally deployed to study the Cascadia subduction zone will now be redeployed along the Alaska Peninsula.

The dotted lines represent locations where earthquakes of magnitude 7 or higher have been recorded. (Image courtesy of Geoff Abers)</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Southwest Alaska has seen North America's largest recorded earthquakes and largest documented volcanic eruptions. Now, a team of geologists will deploy a vast array of seismometers along the Alaska Peninsula in an experiment they hope will solve long-standing mysteries about the region and about earthquakes and volcanoes in general.</p>
<p>Funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the $4.5 million Alaska Amphibious Community Seismic Experiment involves nine research institutions, including UC Santa Cruz. Susan Schwartz, UCSC professor of Earth and planetary sciences, is one of 10 principal investigators for the project, which is led by Geoff Abers of Cornell University.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is something I&#8217;ve wanted to see done for a long, long time,&#8221; Abers said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been working off the Alaska Peninsula since 1990, and it became obvious that the only way to get something of this scale to work is in this kind of collaborative mode.&#8221;</p>
<p>Schwartz was also a principal investigator for the first community seismic experiment, the Cascadia Initiative, which targeted the Cascadia subduction zone off the coast of the Pacific Northwest. An array of land and ocean instruments built for that experiment, called the Amphibious Array Facility, will now be redeployed in Alaska.</p>
<p>&#8220;We held a series of workshops to decide where this facility can go next, and the consensus was to go to Alaska because of the history of very large earthquakes and the high level of seismic hazard in that region,&#8221; Schwartz said. &#8220;Very few regions are as seismically active, and it has an active volcanic chain, so there are many interesting geophysical processes to study.&#8221;</p>
<p>Offshore from the Alaska Peninsula is a subduction zone where the Pacific and North American tectonic plates collide. Ninety percent of all U.S. earthquakes occur here, and it&#8217;s the only location in North America where magnitude 8 and 9 earthquakes have been recorded. Most of the continent&#8217;s known volcanic eruptions have occurred along this subduction zone as well. Despite being such a geologically active area, the remote region hasn&#8217;t been monitored very well, especially at the ocean bottom, according to Abers.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;High-end seismometers</strong></p>
<p>The seismic experiment will scatter 105 high-end seismometers off a 435-mile-long stretch of the peninsula&#8217;s coast that includes the communities of Kodiak, King Salmon, and Sand Point. Broadband seismic equipment will be buried on various islands and ocean-bottom seismometers deployed as far offshore as 300 miles. The array will cross the Aleutian Trench marking the plate boundary where the Pacific plate dives beneath the North American plate.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be using signals from earthquakes we record to try and learn more about what the stuff down there is made out of,&#8221; said Abers. &#8220;Where do the magmas that show up in volcanoes come from? Somewhere below the crust they form and there&#8217;s a lot of debate about what that process is. And how does that actually trigger the volcanoes and why are they where they are?&#8221;</p>
<p>Another mystery geologists will examine is why one particular stretch of the subduction zone hasn&#8217;t recorded a major earthquake in the last several decades while every other stretch has. &#8220;Is there something different about the character of the seafloor here that might help us understand why? Is it a much smoother sea floor or do the faults go deeper?&#8221; asked Abers.</p>
<p>The researchers have mapped the best drop location for each seismometer and Abers is coordinating a deployment schedule with a fleet of research ships. He also worked with Alaskan land owners, educators, and pilots to negotiate land-based locations. The seismometers are scheduled to be deployed in the spring of 2018, with the goal of beginning recovery efforts in the summer of 2019. It won&#8217;t be until then that the data can be collected and provided openly to the entire science community. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of excitement and anticipation for the data,&#8221; said Abers.</p>
<p>Schwartz explained that community experiments use community resources, involve a consensus on the science objectives, and provide immediate open access to the data. &#8220;The idea is pretty new to the geophysical community and it has lots of advantages, especially for young scientists who get immediate access to great data,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Other institutions involved with the project are Colgate University, the U.S. Geological Survey, the University of Washington, the University of Colorado, Columbia University, Washington University, St. Louis, and the University of New Mexico. Ocean-bottom seismometers are provided by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Columbia University&#8217;s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="5dea6422807270176705df1a0b7be042"><name>in-memoriam-barber</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>In Memoriam: Patrick Barber</title><summary>Patrick Barber worked as a member of our campus inspection team as an associate construction inspector with the Office of Physical Planning and Construction (PP&amp;C).

<p>Patrick worked as a member of our campus inspection team as an associate construction inspector with the Office of Physical Planning and Construction (PP&amp;C). He was also a licensed contractor. His family describes him as adventurous, using his construction talents in Australia and Germany where he worked with Warner Brothers. We all knew him as a very friendly person, quick to laugh and share a story. He was an excellent mentor to his less-experienced team members and has supported our Project Managers on multiple projects, the most recent being the Marine Mammal Pool at Long Marine Lab. He was generous with his time and his knowledge. His colleagues will miss him.</p>
<p>Pat grew up in Walnut Creek, California with four brothers. His passion was golfing. He had taken vacation time last week and was able to go golfing with all of his brothers. He is survived by his brothers, his mother plus 12 nieces and nephews.</p>

<p>Published as part of the THE World University Rankings 2018, the analysis measured overall research influence based on the average number of citations per paper, using a database of almost 62 million citations to more than 12.4 million research publications published over five years, from 2012 to 2016.</p>
<p>With a citation score of 99.9, UC Santa Cruz is tied for third place with Stanford University. St. George&#8217;s University of London and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were tied for first. UC Berkeley ranked just behind UCSC and Stanford with a citation score of 99.8.</p>
<p>The 2018 rankings list the top 1,000 universities in the world, comparing them in five areas: teaching (the learning environment); research (volume, income, and reputation); citations (research influence); international outlook (staff, students, and research); and industry income (knowledge transfer).</p>
<p>The research influence indicator looks at the role of universities in spreading new knowledge and ideas. As <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/methodology-world-university-rankings-2018">explained on the website</a> for the World University Rankings, "The citations help to show us how much each university is contributing to the sum of human knowledge: they tell us whose research has stood out, has been picked up and built on by other scholars and, most importantly, has been shared around the global scholarly community to expand the boundaries of our understanding, irrespective of discipline."</p>
<p>UCSC&#8217;s overall ranking in the THE World University Rankings 2018 was 162 out of 1,000 institutions worldwide. In the United States, UC Santa Cruz ranked 55 out of 154 institutions.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="62f7fa51807270176705df1a0507f666"><name>changes-title-nine</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Changes in the Title IX Office</title><summary>As we prepare for the start of a new academic year, I would like to update campus on changes in our Title IX program. </summary><start-date>1504767600000</start-date><display-name>Changes in the Title IX Office</display-name><path>/2017/09/changes-title-nine</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/09/changes-title-nine</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1504898971136</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1504908372861</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Staff</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As we prepare for the start of a new academic year, I would like to update campus on changes in our Title IX program.</p>
<p>Tracey Tsugawa, Title IX Officer and program manager, has announced her departure to assume a position at the University of Oregon. Under Tracey&#8217;s strong leadership during the past three years, the campus successfully implemented the requirements of federal and state Title IX and University of California sexual-violence and sexual-harassment policies. This was no easy task, and we are thankful to have had Tracey at the helm.</p>
<p>Tracey&#8217;s last work day will be Sept. 8. Please join me in thanking her for her contributions to this vital program.</p>
<p>To ensure program stability, I have appointed Cherie Scricca interim Title IX Officer. She will provide leadership while the campus conducts a national recruitment to fill the vacancy. Cherie has extensive experience in sexual-harassment and Title IX programs, having worked at UCLA, the UC Office of the President, and at the University of Oregon. She is highly skilled in both investigations and policy development. Cherie&#8217;s appointment started Sept. 5.</p>
<p>As an additional change, and one that will provide direct executive-level engagement with the Title IX program, the reporting line for the Title IX Officer is being shifted from Business and Administrative Services to the Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor&#8217;s Office. This change will be effective Oct. 1, 2017.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Business and Administrative Services leadership, specifically Vice Chancellor Sarah Latham and Associate Vice Chancellor of Risk and Safety Services Jean Marie Scott, for their oversight of the program over the past year. They have managed the office during a period of increased focus on sexual violence and sexual harassment on college campuses nationwide, coinciding with a growing number of reports.</p>
<p>Finally, I have decided to add a new position of deputy director, and a permanent third investigator. I will be initiating national recruitments for both posts, which are critical to the office&#8217;s success. Once all positions are filled, we will have six full-time staff in the Title IX program, not including staff funded through CARE, our Campus Advocacy Resources and Education program.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our Beyond Compliance initiative&#8212;our effort to engage faculty in reshaping campus culture with the aim of creating an environment free from sexual violence and sexual harassment&#8212;has announced <a href="beyond-compliance-outreach.xml">an ambitious multi-year plan</a> to move the campus closer to this reality.</p>
<p>Our ultimate goal at UC Santa Cruz is to build a safe, inclusive, and supportive environment for teaching, research, learning and working. Sexual violence and sexual harassment have no place on campus.</p>

<div style="font-size: 12.8px;">To our UC Santa Cruz community,</div>
<div style="font-size: 12.8px;"></div>
<div style="font-size: 12.8px;">We are deeply dismayed by the announcement that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program has been rescinded. This decision takes basic rights, including the right to work, away from hundreds of thousands of young undocumented adults throughout the U.S. and hundreds of students who are part of our community here at UC Santa Cruz. It is hard to see this decision as anything but a moral failure.</div>
<div style="font-size: 12.8px;"></div>
<div style="font-size: 12.8px;">Financial hardship, already a concern for many of our DACA students, will be exacerbated. One consequence of this decision, among others, is that they will no longer be eligible for work-study programs to support their education. Undocumented students are already ineligible for Pell grant aid.&#160;</div>
<div style="font-size: 12.8px;"></div>
<div style="font-size: 12.8px;">UC Santa Cruz will stand up for and support our undocumented students and their families. We are committed to providing resources, support, guidance, and legal counsel to help navigate the uncertainty that our undocumented students now face.</div>
<div style="font-size: 12.8px;"></div>
<div style="font-size: 12.8px;">UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Dreamers are a community of motivated, intelligent, caring, and dedicated people. Their contributions to our campus&#8212;serving as interns, working in our departments, colleges, and resource centers&#8212;and their commitment to educational excellence is exemplary. They deserve our unwavering support.</div>
<div style="font-size: 12.8px;"></div>

(Illustration from Sunesys)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Installation is complete on a 91-mile fiber optic cable made possible by UC Santa Cruz that will bring reliable, speedy internet broadband to underserved communities across 430 square miles from Watsonville through the Salinas Valley to Soledad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next steps are to tie local community networks to the high-speed fiber-optic cable. UC Santa Cruz will link its networks, giving it a second connection to the internet backbone to supplement a fiber-optic line from Sunnyvale installed in 2010.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz researchers and students use massive amounts of data for work in genomics, astronomy, and big data, among other projects. Data are transmitted on fiber-optic networks via pulses of light, allowing network capacity to increase by factors of 100. The university has been linked to a statewide ultra high-speed network since 2010, but campus information technology planners recognized the vulnerability of having only a single connection coming from the north.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;With the addition of computing and big data as new legs to the foundation of world-&#173;class research, UCSC will need connectivity beyond the bleeding edge for the foreseeable future,&#8221; said Brad Smith, UC Santa Cruz interim vice chancellor of information technology. &#8220;We were able to think creatively to secure funding for a multi-million-dollar project.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;This was a total win-win,&#8221; said Steve Blum, president of <a href="http://www.tellusventure.com/">Tellus Venture Associates </a>of Marina, who specializes in developing new community broadband systems. &#8220;UCSC got much-needed fiber capacity and, as a result, the Salinas Valley has the same broadband internet that people in Santa Cruz take for granted.&#8221; Previously, broadband service in the Salinas Valley was &#8220;pretty dire,&#8221; Blum said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financial key to the project, Smith said, was that the <a href="http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/">California Public Utilities Commission</a> was looking for proposals to increase broadband access to areas with poor service. In 2012, Smith, in his role as ITS director of research and faculty partnerships, and UCSC network engineer Jim Warner coordinated the Connected Central Coast Unserved and Underserved Broadband Project to document existing internet service in communities from Watsonville south. &#8220;We made the case that we would be serving 11,000 underserved households,&#8221; Smith said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Armed with the data, UCSC partnered with <a href="http://cenic.org/">CENIC (the Corporation for Educational Network Initiatives in California)</a> and <a href="http://sunesys.com/">Sunesys</a>, a telecommunications company that installs and leases fiber-optic networks, to apply for funding from the <a href="http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/casf/">California Advanced Services Fund</a>, a CPUC initiative that promotes deployment of high-quality advanced communications services in the state and funded by a small surcharge on every California phone bill.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April 2014, the state CPUC approved a $10.6 million grant to Sunesys that would cover 80 percent of the estimated $13.3 million cost. Approximately $500,000 in campus funds was used, Smith said. He credited strong support from community organizations and leaders throughout Santa Cruz and Monterey counties in helping secure the grant. The new fiber-optic backbone would bring the potential of high-speed broadband to schools, homes, and businesses throughout the region. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Installation of the 91-mile line was completed at the end of last March, said Steve DeFranco, Sunesys director of sales for the western region. &#160;Now, &#8220;last mile&#8221; projects have begun, bringing faster, less costly, more reliable, and higher capacity broadband from the new backbone into Central California colleges, universities, K-12 schools, homes, and businesses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://cruzio.com">Cruzio</a>, a Santa Cruz retail internet provider, has already connected to the high-speed line in Santa Cruz and is establishing a hub for similar service in Watsonville, using the fiber that runs south.

Our commitment will not waver despite troubling comments Thursday by U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos that suggest the Trump administration will unwind six years of federal enforcement effort aimed at strengthening sexual violence protections on college campuses.</p>
<p>We have in place, as does the entire UC system, procedures for promptly and fairly investigating and resolving sexual violence complaints. UC Santa Cruz remains firmly committed to protecting its students, staff, and faculty from sexual violence and sexual harassment, while ensuring a fair process for all involved.</p>
<p>As I noted in my message Thursday, we have launched an ambitious, multi-year plan to move the campus toward its goal of creating an environment free from sexual violence and sexual harassment. I&#8217;m extremely proud of our <a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/09/beyond-compliance-outreach.html">Beyond Compliance initiative</a>. We are also boosting staffing in our Title IX office.</p>
<p>Our ultimate goal is to create a safe, inclusive, and supportive environment for teaching, research, learning and working. Sexual violence and sexual harassment have no place on our campus. Visit our <a href="https://titleix.ucsc.edu">Title IX Office online</a> to learn more about our program.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Community</audience><admin>Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Marlene Tromp</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="76fc6a85807270176705df1ae058682c"><name>rankings-us-news</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz ranks among top 100 U.S. universities</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz is among the top 100 national universities, according to the latest rankings by 'U.S. News and World Report.'&#13;

We strongly disagree with this decision. It threatens the future of many of our nation&#8217;s brightest minds, including thousands who currently attend or have graduated from the University of California. We are working hard to protect those who could be affected.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services already has stopped accepting new DACA applications. <span color="#ff0000" style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>However, if you already have DACA, and your permit is set to expire between September 5, 2017, and March 5, 2018, you may apply for a two-year renewal.</strong></span></div>
<div><span color="#ff0000" style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></div>
<div><span color="#ff0000" style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>You must apply for renewal no later than October 5, 2017.</strong></span></div>
<div><span color="#ff0000" style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>&#160;</strong></span></div>
<div><span color="#ff0000" style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Even if DACA is phased out permanently on March 5, 2018, applying for a renewal no later than October 5, 2017 is the best opportunity to obtain two more years of protection against deportation and legal authorization to work.</strong></span></div>
<div></div>
<div>We encourage every member of the UC community who currently has DACA to discuss your circumstances with immigration counsel. You may reach the UC Immigrant Legal Services Center here: <a href="mailto:ucimm@law.ucdavis.edu">ucimm@law.ucdavis.edu</a>, or, if you are at UC Berkeley, use this link: <a href="https://undocu.berkeley.edu/legal-support-overview/legal-support-appointments/">https://undocu.berkeley.edu/legal-support-overview/legal-support-appointments/</a>. Together, these offices will be scheduling workshops to assist UC students with renewal applications on every UC campus. Check with these offices or your campus Undocumented Students Coordinator for further information.</div>
<div></div>
<div>With fewer than 30 days before this deadline, we encourage everyone whose DACA permit expires in the next six months to act quickly. And please share this renewal application deadline with others who could benefit.</div>
<div></div>
<div>You may find more information on the renewal process here: <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-process/renew-">https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-process/renew-</a> your-daca</div>
<div></div>
<div>The University of California is working on many fronts to ensure that protections continue for those in our community who, in good faith, joined the DACA program. It is our unequivocal belief that students should be admitted to UC and other institutions of higher education based on their records of achievement and without regard to their immigration status. UC will continue to offer services to our undocumented students, including:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Continuing to allow California residents who are Dreamers to pay in-state tuition;</li>
<li>Maintaining eligibility for institutional and State financial aid awards, including loans through the DREAM loan program (although students whose DACA status expires will not be able to continue to use their work-study authorization);</li>
<li>Offering legal services to our undocumented students;</li>
<li>Supporting campus-based student service centers; and</li>
<li>Directing campus police not to contact, detain, question, or arrest individuals based on suspected undocumented status, or to enter agreements to undertake joint efforts to make arrests for federal immigration law violations.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>We will continue to keep you updated with relevant news as the situation evolves. One of the best ways to stay informed and access additional resources is through our campus undocumented student service offices: <a href="http://undoc.universityofcalifornia.edu/campus-support.html">http://undoc.universityofcalifornia.edu/campus-support.html</a></div>

<p>One of the most dynamic and iconic institutions at UC Santa Cruz, Kresge College has long been recognized for its support of experiential and interdisciplinary education and for its architectural heritage. Kresge College was built in 1973 as the sixth college at UC Santa Cruz, encompassing approximately eight acres of varied topography and redwood forest. Designed by architect Charles Moore of Moore, Lyndon, Turnbull and Whitaker (MLTW) with landscape architect Dan Kiley, the college is designed as a cluster of residential and social buildings clustered around a pedestrian street.</p>
<p>Today, having long outlasted their expected lifespan in a marine climate, many of the materials and details of the stucco campus buildings and hardscape are in need of repair. With Kresge, the campus can no longer meet the residential and academic needs of its students.</p>
<p>In order to honor Kresge&#8217;s cultural and architectural legacy, and improve its ability to serve broader campus and evolving student needs in the coming generations, the project will balance limited redevelopment with the renovation of the majority of existing buildings, extending Moore&#8217;s legacy for future generations of students.</p>
<p>Focused around improving many of the experimental concepts developed by Moore, the project supports creating new spaces for student life and support, including student co-op space; creates more accessible circulation through the college; improves environmental performance; increases residential capacity to keep up with demand; introduces new academic space to strengthen its living-learning mission, and provides direct connections to campus core via the North Bridge.</p>
<p>Now in the planning phase, in which program and site organization are being developed, careful consideration has been paid to which buildings are renovated and which buildings will be replaced in order to honor the legacy of Moore&#8217;s plan while improving the evolving vision. The majority of existing buildings will remain.</p>
<h3>A renewed vision for Kresge</h3>
<p>The college is currently working with Studio Gang Architects in collaboration with TEF Design for the planning phase of the project. Driven by a desire to provide students with the space to enable academic success and improve the student experience, the college has worked closely with Studio Gang to develop planning concepts in collaboration with students, faculty, and staff over the past 18 months. The plan includes creating an academic zone at the north, residential space to the west, and student support and college programs to the south, as well as landscape improvements to create accessible, social gathering places. Key proposed and existing program elements include a new state-of-the-art lecture hall, classrooms, and academic department and Kresge administration space. The new lecture hall will be a campus facility that can be used for many large courses and campus-wide events. It will be the campus&#8217;s largest lecture hall and first new one since 2006. Student support programs and expanded student housing with associated amenities to support college residential life are also included.</p>
<p>&#8220;The hope in developing a new vision for the physical space of Kresge College,&#8221; Kresge Provost Ben Leeds Carson said, &#8220;is to retain, and even to strengthen, Kresge&#8217;s founding values of innovation in experiential learning and community engagement, while transforming and improving its living and learning spaces to the benefit of student services, the college&#8217;s residential and academic life.&#8221;</p>
<p>The housing communities of the five older colleges have all been recently renovated, or are currently being renovated. As with other college renovations, UC Santa Cruz seeks to increase the number of beds at Kresge&#8212;from 363 located within the college site to a maximum of 550&#8212;while also improving the overall student experience through a focus on adding more outdoor community gathering spaces. The expanded student housing will make Kresge College roughly the same size as the other nine colleges.</p>
<p>The total project budget is still being finalized, though the campus anticipates investing at least $243 million, including $50 million earmarked from state funds for the renewal and expansion of academic spaces. Campus leaders will present strategies toward the design and implementation of these and other features at tomorrow&#8217;s UC Board of Regents meeting.</p>
<p>The Kresge Committee is co-chaired by Sarah Latham, vice chancellor for Business and Administrative Services, and Martin Berger, interim associate vice provost for Academic Affairs. Colleges, Housing, and Educational Services reports to Latham. As part of Academic Affairs, Berger helps manage academic space.The committee includes Leeds Carson, Kresge College Administrative Officer Mike Yamauchi-Gleason, two student representatives from Kresge Parliament, Academic Senate representation, and additional campus staff. A GSA representative has been requested.</p>
<p>Town Hall meetings, open to students, staff, faculty, alums and the local community have been held monthly to provide updates on the project&#8217;s progress and to seek feedback on preliminary concepts. Consistent with the robust student involvement with the original design, the campus will continue to seek input from the community. CAO Yamauchi-Gleason encourages all members of the community to participate in the wide range of activities to provide input into the final design of the project. The campus community can learn more at the next forum from 6&#8211;8 p.m. on Monday, Sept 18 in the Kresge Town Hall.</p>
<p>The Kresge project is distinct from Student Housing West, which will be delivered via a public-private partnership that will bring about 3,000 new beds to UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<h3>Project implementation</h3>
<p>The project will be constructed in two phases so that all programs, classrooms, offices, residential beds can remain open through construction. The design phase is planned to start in late fall 2017.</p>
<p>Preliminary concepts for phase one would include two new residential buildings, a new academic building, caf&#233;, and improvements to the north pedestrian bridge for accessibility. Phase one is planned to begin in fall 2019, and anticipated to be completed in fall 2021.</p>
<p>Before phase one starts, the campus will consider removing R-7, the triplet apartments, the fitness center, and the town hall and Owl&#8217;s Nest, which will be replaced by new residential buildings, social amenities, and a cafe. A new town hall would be provided in phase two. Space would be provided for the programs and people impacted.</p>
<p>Preliminary concepts for phase two will focus on rehabilitating most of the remaining Kresge buildings, and includes construction of a new town hall. Before phase two starts, the campus is considering the removal of R8, which could become an outdoor commons including stormwater management; R3, which could be replaced by a set of stairs and ramps allowing for improved accessibility and adding gathering space through the site; and R10, which could become a new Town Hall. Phase two is planned to begin in fall 2021, and anticipated to be completed in fall 2023.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7816a645807270176705df1ab282fa52"><name>dyane-harwood</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>An advocate for awareness</title><summary>Alumna Dyane Harwood is sharing her journey with postpartum bipolar disorder to raise awareness and help others struggling with postpartum mental illness</summary><start-date>1505199600000</start-date><display-name>Dyane Harwood</display-name><path>/2017/09/dyane-harwood</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/09/dyane-harwood</link><created-by>mazeller</created-by><created-on>1505253302802</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1506383885128</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Literature</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Psychology</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Community</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/08/images/dyane-harwood.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/08/images/dyane-harwood.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>dyane-harwood.jpg</name><display-name>dyane-harwood.jpg</display-name><file-size>66285</file-size><width>400</width><height>600</height></image><image-alt>Dyane Harwood</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/08/images/dyane-harwood-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/08/images/dyane-harwood-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>dyane-harwood-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>dyane-harwood-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>4259</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Dyane Harwood</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Dyane Harwood lives in Ben Lomond with her family.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>Alumna Dyane Harwood is sharing her journey with postpartum bipolar disorder to raise awareness and help others struggling with postpartum mental illness</article-subhead><article-text><p>Forty-eight hours after Dyane Harwood gave birth in 2007 she found herself obsessed with writing, a condition called hypergraphia.</p>
<p>She&#8217;d write day and night, bending over her computer even as she breastfed her newborn, Marilla, and her toddler, Avonlea. She felt full of creativity. Her thoughts raced.</p>
<p>What Harwood (Cowell &#8217;91, English and American literature) would discover six weeks later was that her mania and compulsive writing were symptoms of something called postpartum bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a rare condition &#8212; one or two cases per 1,000 live births, according to studies &#8212; &#160;and it set Harwood off on a years-long search for help that included hospitalizations and electroconvulsive therapy. &#160;Eventually, she was able to manage her illness, but along the way she also became an advocate for awareness of the disorder.</p>
<p>October 10, Harwood&#8217;s memoir, <em>Birth of New Brain: Healing from Postpartum Bipolar Disorder,</em> will be released by Post Hill Press.</p>
<p>Says Devon Brown, a spokeswoman for the independent publisher distributed by Simon &amp; Schuster:&#160; &#8220;We hope that by helping Dyane share her personal journey with postpartum bipolar disorder, we can raise awareness and help anyone who may be struggling with postpartum mental illness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harwood sits at her kitchen table, a view of redwood forest out the front window of her Ben Lomond home. She wears jeans and a tank top, and her long, dark hair is pulled off her face. She grew up in the shadow of bipolar disorder, she says.</p>
<p>According to her, her father, a brilliant violinist named Richard Leshin who graduated from Juilliard and was a Fulbright scholar, played with the Los Angeles Philharmonic for nearly four decades. But beneath the veneer of talent was a man whose moods ranged from steep highs to deep lows. In his manic phases, Harwood says, her father would party into the night and go on spending sprees, including once bidding $30,000 at auction for a violin he couldn&#8217;t afford. Sometimes, he would wind up in psychiatric hospitals, where, Harwood says, she felt the shame of mental illness when she came to visit.</p>
<p>Harwood fled north to UC Santa Cruz, where she studied with professors Michael Warren and Page Stegner and with writer and playwright Kathryn Chetkovich and had dreams of becoming a writer. She married Craig Harwood, a geologist and a 1987 Cowell graduate, and worked at a variety of jobs: substitute teacher, special events coordinator, personal trainer, and, eventually, writing for Friends of Santa Cruz State Parks.</p>
<p>When her first child was born, Harwood had a flush of manic energy, but it quickly subsided. Then, her second daughter was born.</p>
<p>Harwood leans forward across the table as she tells the story of feeling so full of energy she was unable to sleep, of the flurry of words that fell from her mouth and her fingers, of the feeling of intense creativity.</p>
<p>She knew something was wrong but wasn&#8217;t sure what it was until her doctor mentioned her apparent mania and she told the physician about her father&#8217;s bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wound up being the very thing I looked down upon,&#8221; Harwood says.</p>
<p>A short time later, she got into an argument with her husband.</p>
<p>&#8220;I started screaming at him and chasing him around the house. I punched him. It was the only violence in our 17 years together,&#8221; Harwood says.</p>
<p>Immediately, she checked herself into a psychiatric hospital, beginning what would be years of looking for a way to manage the illness. She also decided not to be quiet about her disorder.</p>
<p>A year after her diagnosis, Harwood formed the Santa Cruz County Chapter of the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, facilitating free support groups for women with mood disorders in Santa Cruz and the San Lorenzo Valley. She was interviewed by local newspapers and wrote articles about postpartum-onset bipolar disorder that appeared in the <em>Huffington Post</em> and <em>SELF</em> magazine. She believes her family history, sleep disruption, and hormones played a role in the onset of her illness and that &#8220;so much could have been prevented if only my doctor (obstetrician) had asked me if I had a family history of bipolar disorder earlier.&#8221;</p>
<p>One important change that needs to be made, she says, is a mental health screening for women who are pregnant.</p>
<p>As her Scottish collie named Lucy barks from the backyard, Harwood says her disorder is under control with a combination of therapy and therapeutic drugs &#8212; lithium and a monoamine oxidase inhibitor&#160; &#8212; and that her children ask her about the possibility of them suffering the same illness.</p>
&#8220;I tell them that, statistically, the chances are low,&#8221; Harwood says, &#8220;but even if you do have it, we know what to do.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7d77edf0807270176705df1a0a96db25"><name>daca-workshops</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>DACA renewal workshops</title><summary>UC Santa Cruz is offering two workshops about renewing paperwork for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program for students and their immediate family members. </summary><start-date>1505286000000</start-date><display-name>DACA</display-name><path>/2017/09/daca-workshops</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/09/daca-workshops</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1505343564236</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1505346369508</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>News Briefs</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>UC Santa Cruz is offering two workshops about renewing paperwork for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program for students and their immediate family members.</p>

<p>"It turns out that improving the performance of mirrors is all about thin-film materials, and that's what I do. So then I got hooked," said Kobayashi, a professor of electrical engineering in the <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a> at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>The astronomer was Joseph Miller, former director of <a href="http://ucolick.org/">UC Observatories</a> (UCO), whose interest led to a thriving collaboration between Kobayashi and UC Santa Cruz astronomers Andrew Phillips and Michael Bolte. With funding from the National Science Foundation and support from current UCO director Claire Max, the researchers are developing new protective coatings for large silver-based telescope mirrors by adapting a technique widely used in the microelectronics industry.</p>
<p>According to Phillips, most astronomical telescope mirrors use aluminum for the reflective layer, despite the superior reflective properties of silver. "Silver is the most reflective material, but it is finicky to work with, and it tarnishes and corrodes easily," he said. "You need barrier layers on top that can keep anything from getting through to the silver without messing up the optical characteristics of the mirror."</p>
<p><strong>Increased efficiency</strong></p>
<p>Existing telescopes could substantially increase their efficiency by recoating their mirrors with silver instead of aluminum. "It is by far the cheapest way to make our telescopes effectively bigger," said Bolte. "The reason we want bigger telescopes is to collect more light, so if your mirrors reflect more light it's like making them bigger."</p>
<p>The new coating technology being developed at UC Santa Cruz could make that feasible. The researchers are using a technique called atomic layer deposition (ALD), which gradually builds a thin film of material, one molecular layer at a time, with excellent uniformity, thickness control, and conformity to the surface of the substrate. In a pilot study, ALD provided much better protective coatings for silver mirror samples than traditional physical deposition techniques.</p>
<p>"Atomic layer deposition performs significantly better," Phillips said. "The problem is that the systems used in the electronics industry are designed for silicon wafers, so they're too small for a telescope mirror."</p>
<p><strong>Patented concept</strong></p>
<p>The results of the pilot study, which used an ALD system in Kobayashi's lab designed for microelectronics, convinced the team to design a larger system that could accommodate telescope mirrors. They filed for a patent on their concept and found an equipment vendor willing to work with them to build the system. The vendor, Structured Materials Industries (SMI) in Piscataway, New Jersey, makes thin-film deposition systems for the microelectronics industry.</p>
<p>"We gave them the concept and our requirements, and they did the engineering design work and fabrication," Kobayashi said.</p>
<p>The new system was delivered to his laboratory in July and has performed well in initial testing. The researchers will use the system to demonstrate that it works for telescope mirrors and other large substrates and to continue perfecting the coatings. The system can accommodate a mirror up to 0.9 meters in diameter, and there is no reason the design could not be scaled up to accommodate even larger mirrors or mirror segments, Phillips said. The 10-meter primary mirrors of the twin Keck Telescopes in Hawaii are composed of hexagonal segments 1.8 meters across, and the mirror segments for the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) will be 1.4 meters across.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Recoating<br/></strong></p>
<p>According to Bolte, the desire to use silver on the TMT mirror segments is a major driver of their research on new coating technologies. But he expects the technology will also be used to recoat the mirrors of existing telescopes. An aluminum-coated mirror lasts about three to five years before it needs recoating, a process that puts the telescope temporarily out of action.</p>
<p>"We hate to lose telescope time, and we lose a lot of nights recoating segments at Keck," Phillips said. "We'd like to have a silver coating that could last five to ten years."</p>
<p>At this point, the researchers are using a physical deposition process to put the silver coating on the mirror blanks along with an initial barrier layer to protect the silver while the mirror is transferred to the ALD system. Atomic layer deposition is then used for the final barrier layers.</p>
<p>"Right now, it's a hybrid process, but we're following the development of atomic layer deposition for the silver coating as well," Phillips said.</p>
<p>Bolte said the new technology could have a big impact in astronomy, in the same way that the advent of digital detectors to replace photographic plates gave new life to small telescopes throughout the world several decades ago. "This is the last trick we have to make existing telescopes more efficient," he said. "It could really make a big difference."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="9682faa6807270176705df1a64785d2c"><name>first-gen-initiative</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Supporting our First Generation Initiative</title><summary>With more than 42 percent of our undergraduate students among the first generation in their families to seek a four-year college or university degree, UC Santa Cruz has proudly launched a First Generation Initiative.</summary><start-date>1505458800000</start-date><display-name>First Generation Initiative</display-name><path>/2017/09/first-gen-initiative</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/09/first-gen-initiative</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1505763718767</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1505763718767</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div>With more than 42 percent of our undergraduate students among the first generation in their families to seek a four-year college or university degree, UC Santa Cruz has proudly launched a <a href="https://firstgen.ucsc.edu">First Generation Initiative</a>.

<p>His official job title is &#8220;Bob Dylan Librarian and Collections Manager.&#8221; Davidson is now the head archivist and librarian of the collection, working closely with Bob Dylan Archive curator Michael Chaiken, who lives in New York City.&#160;</p>
<p>The Dylan Archive includes 6,000 mostly unseen items from Dylan&#8217;s own personal collection, going back more than 50 years. According to the <em>New York Times</em>, it was recently acquired by the George Kaiser Family Foundation for a reported $15 million to $20 million. The archive is now held at the Gilcrease Museum of American History in a partnership with the University of Tulsa and the city of Tulsa.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Kaiser Foundation also owns and administers The Woody Guthrie Archives and the Woody Guthrie Center in the city and is responsible for a number of renovation and revitalization projects throughout Tulsa,&#8221; Davidson noted.</p>
<p>But he said that the Bob Dylan Archive is not open to the public. It is instead a research collection that is designed to become an incredible resource for academic study.</p>
<p>Still, tourists shouldn&#8217;t despair. The Kaiser Foundation is currently sorting through bids to create a Bob Dylan Center in Tulsa, which, like the Guthrie Center, will be the public face of the collection. &#160;</p>
<p><strong>Highlights of the Dylan collection</strong> include hundreds of original tape reels, unseen concert films, lyric sheets, and personal correspondence from the beginning of his career.&#160;</p>
<p>It also includes digital copies of the raw session tapes from every one of Dylan&#8217;s studio albums, though as a <em>Rolling Stone</em> article recently pointed out, &#8220;the master tapes will remain safely tucked away at the atomic-bomb-proof Iron Mountain storage facility in upstate New York.&#8221;</p>
<p>The collection also features outtakes and hours of unseen footage from the film <em>Don&#8217;t Look Back</em>, and the Dylan-directed <em>Renaldo and Clara</em>, shot on the Rolling Thunder Revue tour, plus rare video footage of Dylan working in the studio on such albums as <em>New Morning</em> and <em>Infidels</em>.&#160;</p>
<p>And according to <em>Rolling Stone</em>, there is even an hour of 16mm film that shows Dylan hanging out with The Band (and Tiny Tim) during the Basement Tapes era.</p>
<p><strong>Davidson earned his Ph.D. in cultural musicology</strong> from UC Santa Cruz in 2015. His dissertation was titled <em>Recording the Nation: Folk Music and the Government in Roosevelt&#8217;s New Deal, 1936&#8211;1941</em>. At&#160;more than 800 pages (two volumes, double-sided) Davidson noted, &#8220;It doubles as an excellent doorstop or booster seat for short people like myself who have trouble seeing over the steering wheel.&#8221;</p>
<p>While completing his Ph.D., Davidson moved to Austin to enroll in the Master of Science in Information Studies program at the University of Texas at Austin, where he studied archival practices, academic librarianship, and audio preservation.&#160;</p>
<p>He also taught a graduate seminar titled&#160;"Information Policy: Music, Copyright, and Technology". &#8220;My interest in music and copyright came from working with the late, great UCSC music professor Frederic Lieberman as his assistant on some music copyright cases.&#8221;</p>
<p>While in Austin, Davidson additionally worked as a research assistant for historian Douglas Brinkley, currently CNN&#8217;s presidential historian and a professor of history at Rice University. &#8220;I also moonlighted as an assistant for a rare bookseller out of Lockhart, Texas, not far from Austin, and home of some of the best BBQ in the nation,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>Davidson reflected on why he was selected for the coveted position at the Dylan Archive. There certainly was plenty of competition.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think my getting the job was fortuitous--the result of timing, luck, and having the right combination of degrees and experience. I have a vivid memory of driving Highway 1 out to Watsonville and listening to news of the economic downturn of 2008 and thinking, maybe I should get a library science degree as a backup.&#8221;&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;What started as a fear-induced fallback plan (coupled with my upbringing as a &#8216;practical&#8217; Midwesterner) turned into the best decision I ever made,&#8221; said Davidson. &#8220;The background in archives and libraries made me a better scholar in general, and opened up new avenues for scholarship. Plus--and it's a big plus--there's a public service component to the profession that I really like. I think there's a general sense in the academy that such non-academic positions are somehow lesser goals or achievements, but I can't imagine a better opportunity to use my experience and interests.&#8221;</p>
<p>So how big a Dylan fan is he?</p>
<p>&#8220;Dylan was always on my radar, and I spent a good deal of time in my late teens and 20s listening to his music. As is the case with the devotees of the Grateful Dead--as I'm sure the people at UCSC's Dead Archive can attest to--&#8216;Dylanologists&#8217; aspire to an encyclopedic knowledge of everything Bob Dylan. But thankfully, I have a wide range of experience and knowledge around Dylan and the history of folk music, blues, and rock 'n' roll to pass muster.&#8221;</p>

<div></div>
<div>This is an exciting period for our students and their families, and an excellent opportunity for us to welcome them to our university and community. However, residential Move-In has impacts on campus parking and traffic and we ask for your patience and flexibility. It is important to note the following restrictions and alternative parking options:&#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8226; <strong>Most of the parking lots near colleges, and all three remote lots, will be restricted for Move-In purposes on different days during Move-In.</strong> On Thursday, close-in lots near Porter College will be restricted. On Friday, close-in lots near Merrill and Kresge will be restricted. For access during the weekend, please check the maps below for details:</div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/pdf/lot-impacts-wed.pdf">Restricted parking lot maps for Wednesday 9/20</a></div>
<div><a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/pdf/lot-impacts-fri.pdf">Restricted parking lot maps for Friday 9/22</a></div>
<div><a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/pdf/lot-impacts-sat.pdf">Restricted parking lot maps for Saturday 9/23</a></div>
<div><a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/pdf/lot-impacts-sun.pdf">Restricted parking lot maps for Sunday 9/24</a></div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8226; <strong>Vehicles without a valid Move-In permit will be cited if they park in restricted lots.</strong> (Vehicles with disability-related permits or placards are the exception to this rule.)</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8226; <strong>Because of these restrictions, those with A, B, or R permits may need to find alternative parking.</strong> Please check the day-specific maps for non-restricted parking options listed above. Those with R permits will be able to park in <a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/pdf/104-overflow-map.pdf">East Remote Overflow Lots 2, 4, and 5</a> during Move In.&#160;</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8226; <strong>On Wednesday, and from Friday through Sunday, one-way traffic controls will be in place on Porter-Kresge Road. </strong>Traffic will only be allowed to go from Kresge to Porter; no traffic will be allowed to drive into the Porter entrance. Those needing to access Porter must enter through Kresge.</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8226; <strong>From Friday through Sunday, Hagar Drive will be closed to downhill traffic at Steinhart Way.</strong> Drivers are asked to use southbound Coolidge Drive (overlooking the Pogonip) to exit campus or access areas on Hagar south of the closure.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We anticipate thousands of additional vehicles on campus for the move-in period. This creates a significant challenge for the campus community, particularly on Friday. Principal officers and managers are encouraged to consider alternative work sites for staff members at the discretion of the supervisor, if operationally feasible. We strongly encourage the use of alternative transportation options to get to campus (such as sharing a ride with a friend or colleague) to help accommodate the new student traffic.</div>
<div></div>

Transportation and parking-specific details can be found at the <a href="https://taps.ucsc.edu/event-parking/move-in-employees.html">TAPS website</a>.

Thank you in advance for helping to support a smooth start to the new academic year.</div>

Playing on the narrow layout at Santa Cruz&#8217;s Pasatiempo Golf Club for the first time, the Roseville freshman was admittedly nervous, and she was hitting balls out of bounds as a result.</p>
<p>She didn&#8217;t qualify for the travel team, carding two matching scores of 111 across 36 holes. But <a href="http://www.goslugs.com/sports/wgolf/index">UC Santa Cruz women&#8217;s golf</a> coach Paulette Pera opted to bring Edwards to a season-opening tournament in Texas, nonetheless.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m glad I brought her,&#8221; Pera said, after Edwards shaved a whopping 25 strokes from her qualifying round by recording a team-best 86 during the first round of the Lady Bulldog Fall Classic on Sept. 11. &#8220;We got her hitting the ball a little bit straighter and because of that, she got in less precarious positions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She got that experience,&#8221; Pera added, &#8220;so that&#8217;s good.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Edwards&#8217; turnaround performance proved just how fickle golf can be, it also provided a snapshot at the individual potential of the Banana Slugs moving forward. And with Pera&#8217;s goal to lower the team&#8217;s scoring average as the season progresses, it was also an encouraging sign for the Slugs, whose focus is very much on the future.</p>
<p>Youthful, to be sure, the 2017&#8211;18 Slugs include no seniors and just two juniors on their nine-player roster. But after last season&#8217;s continued growth resulted in the Slugs earning a sixth-place finish at the American Southwest Conference championships&#8212;a positive after the team finished in the back of the pack for much of the year&#8212;Pera believes her team this season can continue that upward trajectory.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;re all improving. We&#8217;re all building it up,&#8221; Edwards said. &#8220;And I think we&#8217;re going to improve every round and hopefully win some tournaments in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>The future is bright after UC Santa Cruz students in May voted to approve a new student fee to support athletics. The stability will leave fewer question marks for coaches looking to recruit.</p>
<p>That will help Pera, who started the program 15 years ago.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s newcomers include Edwards&#8212;a &#8220;boomer&#8221; off the tee, Pera said&#8212;as well as Jessica Salazar (Orange) and Angie Yang (Menlo Park). Salazar finished as the top Slug with a 20-over 164 (82&#8211;82) at the California State Intercollegiate on Sept. 18&#8211;19.</p>
<p>Yang attended Menlo-Atherton High and garnered first-team all-league honors during her senior season.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have high expectations for her after seeing her scores in high school,&#8221; Pera said.</p>
<p>While attending Wahkiakum High as a junior foreign exchange student, new Slug Sarah Shi qualified for the state tournament, becoming the first female from the Cathlamet, Wash., school to do so, according to The Daily News (Longview, Wash.).</p>
<p>In Texas, Shi finished as the top Slug after carding a 178 (89&#8211;89).</p>
<p>&#8220;And I see nothing but better things coming from her as well,&#8221; Pera said of Shi, who is from China. Shi shot 21-over 165 (85&#8211;80) at the California State Intercollegiate, which was held at Olivas Links Golf Course in Ventura.</p>
<p>Juniors Julia Martin (Cameron Park) and Victoria Morales (Perris) have continued to shave strokes since the beginning of last season, Pera said, while sophomore Maia Dupuis (Antioch) is also back in the fold.</p>
<p>Sophomore Sean Hong (Riverside), who shot a 186 in Ventura, is one of the top returners for UCSC. She spent much of the summer practicing her putting, either on the course or on a mat inside her house.</p>
<p>During the first round in Texas, she didn&#8217;t record any three-putts en route to an 89.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her short game has improved a lot,&#8221; Pera said.</p>
<p>Continuing that improvement, among Hong and others, is key during the 2017&#8211;18 golf season, which breaks in early October before picking up again in late March. It&#8217;s up to the players to not get too rusty, Pera said.</p>

<p>The annual award, a $10,000 scholarship, is administered by SMSC and the UCSC Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology to help carry out a mission to provide high-quality primary care to Central Coast Medi-Cal patients. The award supports a graduating UCSC senior who will be entering an accredited medical school, and the recipient must intend to return to the Central Coast to practice in primary care.</p>
<p>&#8220;Saloni has an outstanding academic background, and she has been contributing her time and skills to support important health initiatives in the community,&#8221; said Stephen Gray, SMSC chief administrative officer. &#8220;She is the ideal choice for this year&#8217;s primary care scholarship award, and we wish her well in her pursuits in medical school.&#8221;</p>
<p>Saloni was born and raised in San Mateo, California. She first became interested in medicine as a high school sophomore when she became a research assistant in a pediatric immunology lab at the Center for Clinical Sciences Research at Stanford University. Saloni continued her research on systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis throughout her undergraduate career.</p>
<p>She entered UC Santa Cruz as an undergraduate Regent&#8217;s Scholar in human biology. At UCSC, Saloni pursued research in social psychology, examining attitudes about gender, colorism, and arranged marriage in the South Asian diaspora.</p>
<p>Saloni has been involved with the Santa Cruz AIDS Project for the past two years, and she gives monthly educational presentations on harm reduction and safety at youth and adult recovery facilities. She also leads weekly mindfulness classes for clients who are HIV positive, giving them a way to decompress.</p>
<p>Saloni works part-time as a medical scribe in the emergency department of El Camino Hospital and has most recently taken a leadership role as a scribe trainer.</p>
<p>As a student at UC Santa Cruz, Saloni has earned quarterly Dean&#8217;s Academic Honors. She will graduate with honors in December 2017 and is planning to apply to medical schools in June 2018. As a physician, she hopes to return to Santa Cruz to practice primary care for Medi-Cal patients.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="baa35dc9807270176705df1aba5f64a7"><name>preventing-sexual-violence</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Commitment to preventing sexual violence</title><summary>Here at UC Santa Cruz we are committed to preventing sexual violence and sexual harassment, and responding swiftly and fairly when incidents are reported to our Title IX Office.</summary><start-date>1506063600000</start-date><display-name>Commitment to preventing sexual violence</display-name><path>/2017/09/preventing-sexual-violence</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/09/preventing-sexual-violence</link><created-by>clagattu</created-by><created-on>1506369821060</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1506369821060</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><div class="moz-text-html" lang="x-unicode">

<div>I am deeply troubled by today's announcement by the U.S. Department of Education to reverse the guidance that has strengthened sexual violence protections on college campuses. It sends the wrong message to students across the nation.</div>

</article-subhead><article-text><p>In 2006, visionary economist Muhammad Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize for his concept of "microfinance," an anti-poverty strategy that provides small loans to entrepreneurs who are too poor to qualify for traditional bank loans. A decade later, Yunus is offering a prescription for global economic and environmental empowerment in his new book, <em>A World of Three Zeros: The New Economics of Zero Poverty, Zero Unemployment, and Zero Net Carbon Emissions</em>.</p>
<p>The public is invited to attend a free talk by Yunus on Tuesday, October 10, in the College 9/10 Multipurpose Room at UC Santa Cruz. The event begins at 7 p.m. The event is cosponsored by the <a href="https://blumcenter.ucsc.edu/">Blum Center on Poverty, Social Enterprise and Participatory Governance at UC Santa Cruz</a> and Bookshop Santa Cruz. Tickets are not required, but attendees can reserve their priority spot for the book signing by <a href="http://www.bookshopsantacruz.com/event/muhammad-yunus-world-three-zeroes">preordering</a> a copy of <em>A World of Three Zeroes</em> from Bookshop Santa Cruz. Yunus's talk will be followed by a question-and-answer session and book signing; copies of <em>A World of Three Zeroes</em> will be available for purchase at the event.</p>
<p>"We are delighted to partner with Bookshop Santa Cruz to bring Muhammad Yunus to Santa Cruz," said Heather Bullock, a professor of psychology and the director of the Blum Center. "His vision of a new economic system offers a path toward the alleviation of human suffering caused by poverty and inequality, as well as the environmental destruction caused by capitalism."</p>
<p>Yunus, a native of Bangladesh, shared the Nobel Peace Prize with the Grameen Bank, which he founded to provide micro-credit loans to the poor. Today he is a powerful voice for social and environmental justice.</p>
<p>His vision of a new economic system is based on altruism and innovation designed to serve human needs rather than accumulate wealth. Over the past decade, businesses have embraced this model to bring solar energy to millions of homes in Bangladesh; turn thousands of unemployed young people into entrepreneurs through equity investments; finance women-owned businesses across the United States; and bring mobility, shelter, and services to the rural poor in France. Around the globe, a support network helps young entrepreneurs launch start-ups.</p>
<p>A combination of vision, social action, and new financial tools is forging the future, according to Yunus, who says legal and regulatory changes are needed to foster the next wave of socially driven innovations.</p>
<p>"Yunus is inviting all of us to join this movement to create a better world," said Bullock. "It's a compelling, hopeful vision that's needed now more than ever."</p>
<p>At the event, parking will be available for $4 at the Core West parking structure at the corner of McLaughlin and Heller Drives; free shuttles will be available to transport attendees to the event.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://blumcenter.ucsc.edu/">Blum Center on Poverty, Social Enterprise and Participatory Governance at UC Santa Cruz</a> is part of a network of centers working on poverty across all ten UC campuses. UCSC takes a multifaceted approach to poverty alleviation, focusing on fiscal equity, housing, and food access. The center is dedicated to illuminating the causes and consequences of poverty and to demonstrating how participatory governance and effective policies and programs can alleviate economic hardship.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bb14df39807270176705df1a5e4a6cdb"><name>move-in-photos</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Move-in 2017, a photographic journey</title><summary>Move-in is always a time of mixed emotions: anticipation, joy, excitement, and even nervousness for students.

</article-subhead><article-text><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For most, college move-in week brings up classic images of tiny microwaves, milk-crate shelving, and well-loved teddy bears. One thing that list of imagery probably doesn&#8217;t include? Blue tarps. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the UC Santa Cruz campus was a sea of them during move-in last week. Parents, siblings, and jittery undergraduates were laying out their tarps on lawns and sidewalks outside their dormitories, and piling them high with TV sets, mini fridges, throw pillows, and Costco-sized multi-packs of Frosted Flakes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving into a new place can be stressful for students, but there was also an air of expectancy. &#160;&#8220;I have lots of mixed emotions,&#8221; said </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zoe Bergsvic of Bellevue, Wash., who was standing in front of Stevenson College and preparing to board a shuttle with her parents. &#8220;But it&#8217;s also exciting. There will be a lot of freedoms that I&#8217;ve never had in my life before coming here.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Bergsvic, it felt like starting over. &#8220; I don&#8217;t know anybody here, except for the people I met at orientation, she said. Bergsvic had never met her roommates in person, though she&#8217;d texted with them a few times. &#8220;They seem nice,&#8221; she added. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All across the campus, new students from built-up urban areas adjusted to the natural landscape. One of them leaned out of her car and stared, mesmerized, at a deer that was blocking part of McLaughlin Drive through campus. Others took selfies with a flock of wild turkeys hanging out near McHenry Library.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harried-looking parents lugged heavy duffel bags up multiple flights of stairs and shared timely advice with their children. The campus was buzzing with life, with 5,360 new undergraduates getting ready for college life, 4,650 of them from California. UC Santa Cruz expects 1,260 will be transfer students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help students adjust, the campus set up activities throughout move-in week, including &#8220;Fast Friends,&#8221; an activity in Cowell Courtyard in which students spend a few minutes talking with other students, before moving on to the next potential pal. Volunteers hung around to help facilitate the conversations. Cowell even had a mixer in which students built makeshift forts and &#8220;battled&#8221; their new friends with a variety of board games. </span></p>
<p><strong>A mother&#8217;s advice: &#8220;Follow your heart&#8221; </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some students were anxious about living away from home for the first time ever, but this was not the case for Katelynn August, a socially conscious world traveler from Carlsbad, Ca.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dormitory living won&#8217;t be all that jarring for August, who knows what it is like to live several time zones away from her parents, sometimes in makeshift housing with no Wi-Fi or email access. August has been involved with a volunteer abroad program called AMIGOS de Las Americas since 2014, journeying to the Dominican Republic and Paraguay to develop sustainable projects and educate youth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">August has seen a lot of the world for an 18-year-old. This summer, she heeded the call of the American Red Cross, which called out for volunteers in the wake of Hurricane Irma, whose 165-mile-an-hour winds have killed 75 people across Florida and inflicted an estimated $65 billion in damage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I was heartbroken that people were getting flooded, that they were leaving their houses on jet skis,&#8221; August said. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t bear to be in a nice place just hanging out when people were suffering. I wanted to be able to go and relieve that stress and help provide comfort. Going and helping in those situations&#8212;that brings me happiness.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">August said she chose UC Santa Cruz in part because the coursework will prepare her for a career as a nurse practitioner helping children in Latin American countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">August&#8217;s mother, Alison Owen, has worked hand-in-hand with August, serving with volunteers building homes in Mexico with her. Owen&#8217;s words of wisdom during move-in were short and went right to the point: &#8220;Follow your heart,&#8217;&#8217; she said. </span></p>
<p><strong>Greetings from campus leaders, and a father&#8217;s words of wisdom</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At Stevenson college, UC Santa Cruz Chancellor George Blumenthal was making the rounds with Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Marlene Tromp. Both were getting a bit nostalgic as they greeted students and parents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The parents are both excited and a little bit apprehensive,&#8221; Blumenthal observed. &#8220;But you know what? I get that&#8212;I am a parent. I did this too. But it is such a great experience to see them. I love that enthusiasm.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tromp had some flashbacks of her own. &#8220;When I was watching people move the boxes, and take out the study pillows, and take out their little trinkets, it reminded me so much of being a college freshman and moving in,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It helps you feel that same excitement again.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nearby, Nia Alexander, 18, an East Bay resident, was excited about immersing herself in her psychology major. She has spent summers away from home, going to camp, so she didn&#8217;t seem especially concerned about living a couple of hours away from her parents. &#8220;They&#8217;ll get over it, right?&#8221; she said with a laugh. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">"I heard that!&#8221; said Nia&#8217;s father, Jeff Alexander, who was standing nearby. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Alexander admitted that he was a little nervous. &#8220;We are praying God will watch over her,&#8217;&#8217; he said. &#8220;At least I am. When she got her high school diploma, I saw that she had grown up, about to venture out on her own.&#8221; Though he&#8217;s happy for her, it felt like a time warp. &#8220;She was a baby, then, bam, she&#8217;s grown now? Wow!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least the two of them now have something in common: both are embarking on a college career at the same time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeff Alexander dropped out of college years ago so he could work. He was never really serious about pursuing a degree until now. These days, he is studying at Delta College pursuing an associate degree in business administration. &#160;He said he hopes his decision to go back to school will encourage her to apply herself: &#8220;I know there will be a lot of opportunities to have a good time, party, or whatever, but I just want to say, &#8216;Stay focused. Don&#8217;t forget about your goal, and why you are here. Stay up on your grades. Take care of things.&#8217; She&#8217;ll be all right.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar scenes were unfolding all over campus. Nearby, at the Cowell College quad, Jon Dewey, 18, of Santa Clara, was getting ready to embark on a computer science major. But first he had to get a tarp-load of materials out of his father&#8217;s SUV and into the top floor of his dorm, an undertaking that required several trips. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While some students were getting emotional, Dewey was just focusing on the task at hand. &#8220;It hasn&#8217;t really hit me just yet,&#8217;&#8217; he said, while taking up another armload of materials.</span></p>

His main words of advice for his son: Get ready for some big changes, and sooner than you think. &#8216;&#8217;Really in the first three months,&#8221; he said. &#8220;At Christmastime, you are almost a completely different person. You will think back on the guy you were in high school and you hardly recognize that person anymore.&#8221; </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/09/move-in-photos.html</url><title>Move-in: A photographic journey</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="bfdd6280807270176705df1a31d9fc3d"><name>art-in-the-arboretum</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Ravens, wolves, and floating orbs: Outdoor artworks enchant visitors to the UC Santa Cruz Arboretum</title><summary>Mysterious bronze wolves, giant eucalyptus leaves, and delicate ceramics await visitors to “Art in the Arboretum: Environmental Installations."&#13;

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Art in the Arboretum: Environmental Installations,&#8221; a collection of 11 artistic installations on an environmental theme, opened in May, and has been drawing crowds to the the vibrant 135-acre garden ever since, while drawing more attention to the Arboretum; visits are up 30 percent this year. The exhibit runs through November 17.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exhibit features original artworks designed specifically for this &#8220;living museum&#8221; of rare and endangered plants from Mediterranean climates. Before completing their installations, the artists walked through the gardens and got a sense of the space, said Susana Arias, local artist and curator of the exhibition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This creative experiment blends art with the natural beauty of nature, drawing visitors into under-visited sections of the park, including its New Zealand and South African groves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some pieces are large and dominate the visual space, like Jayson Fann&#8217;s human-sized nest of eucalyptus branches. &#8220;Sequoia Semper Protea,&#8221; Wendy Domster&#8217;s contribution to the exhibit, is made from dozens of redwood branches that she collected after storms tore through the Santa Cruz Mountains last winter. The long branches curve upward, surrounding a circular metal stand, creating the illusion of an immense blossom in the middle of an open meadow. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other pieces are small and tucked among the plants, making visitors feel as if they have discovered these attractions on their own. In Sharon Loper&#8217;s &#8220;The Raven and the Wolf,&#8221; two life-sized wolf figures skulk under the trees, possibly stalking their prey. Not far from the pair, midway up a tree, artist Larry Worley&#8217;s hand-dyed, rattan reed and driftwood shell captures the viewer&#8217;s attention. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The artists drew inspiration from the natural features of the Arboretum. In Ethan Estess&#8217;s enigmatic piece &#8220;Gas Field,&#8221; pinkish globes bounce and sway with the breeze on thin steel stems; they bob and float in the wind like the plants around them. The piece blends in with its idyllic surroundings; this may come as a surprise, considering these orbs are old gas cans that Estess collected from a garbage dump in San Francisco. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to create an eye-catching, flower-like display that would reference the natural beauty of the Arboretum, yet also encourage visitors to contemplate our role in protecting ecosystems,&#8221; Estess said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visitors can come up with their own pathways through the exhibit. They could start at the top of the hill in the South African garden, walking along the path in a counterclockwise loop toward the New Zealand groves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or they might wander through the entire Arboretum, taking in each scene as it appears before them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s best if visitors discover the installations without preconceived ideas about what to expect,&#8221; said Larry Worley, one of the contributing artists. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even the time of day has an impact on the experience. During a typical misty summer morning in Santa Cruz, the exhibits had a sleepy, serene quality. In that light, John Hylton&#8217;s &#8220;Suncatchers,&#8221; a set of three humanoid wooden figures, looked like a relic from an ancient time. As the clouds faded, the emerging sunshine added vibrancy to the scene. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jenni Ward&#8217;s &#8220;Umbel Series,&#8221; a curving path of electric yellow between patches of trees, is an especially fine installation for sunny days. The piece was inspired by a story of the Spanish settlers leaving trails of mustard seeds up and down the coast of California, creating an 800-mile path connecting the missions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is more art on the horizon for the Arboretum, which is now in its 53rd year. The Arboretum&#8217;s executive director, Martin Quigley, will soon team up with John Weber, founding director of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Institute of the Arts &amp; Sciences, to bring an audio installation to the grounds. Additionally, pioneering eco-artists and professors emeriti of art Newton Harrison and Helen Mayer Harrison are planning an exhibit for the upcoming year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, visitors can enjoy meandering journeys through the art installations, which beckon from the groves and invite guests to linger. It&#8217;s as if each step heightens one&#8217;s awareness, while calling attention to the birds, shrubs, flowers, bugs, wind, and sunlight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those elements are part of what make the exhibit unique, since they exert their own influence on the art&#8217;s appearance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I encourage visitors to keep going back to the Arboretum to revisit the installations and see how time and weather alter the exhibit,&#8221; Ward said. </span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="c4b9bc4e807270176705df1a43f92356"><name>friedman-esa</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Dan Friedman named president-elect of Economic Science Association</title><start-date>1506495600000</start-date><display-name>Friedman-ESA</display-name><path>/2017/09/friedman-esa</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2017/09/friedman-esa</link><created-by>jmcnulty</created-by><created-on>1506539059209</created-on><last-modified-by>jmcnulty</last-modified-by><last-modified>1506539059209</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Economics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Jennifer McNulty</name><title></title><phone/><email>jmcnulty@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/09/images/friedman_dan-200.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/09/images/friedman_dan-200.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>friedman_dan-200.jpg</name><display-name>friedman_dan-200.jpg</display-name><file-size>78852</file-size><width>200</width><height>300</height></image><image-alt>Photo of Dan Friedman</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2017/09/images/friedman-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2017/09/images/friedman-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>friedman-80.jpg</name><display-name>friedman-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>9350</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Photo of Dan Friedman</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Dan Friedman</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Dan Friedman, professor of economics, has been named president-elect of the <a href="https://www.economicscience.org/index.html">Economic Science Association</a> (ESA).

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one corner of the exhibition gallery, museum goers contemplate a series of projections against a bare wall. The moving images look like wood-cut prints: a house disintegrates in a fierce rainstorm, a hoodie-wearing youth stares into the distance, tumbleweeds pile against a barbed-wire fence, and lighting strikes an isolated cabin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This vivid stop-motion-animation display is the work of Bridget Henry (Porter &#8217;95, art), one of the UC Santa Cruz alumnae who collaborated with Santa Cruz County foster youth on the exhibition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In imagining this artwork, Henry worked closely with foster youth, whose life stories inspired the metaphorical images on the wall. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That spirit of personal and artistic cooperation infuses the entire exhibition, the result of a partnership between MAH and the Foster Youth Museum, a traveling collection of art and artifacts made by current and former foster youth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The exhibition, which runs through December 31, draws attention to 60,000 youth in California&#8217;s foster care system, while highlighting the creative contributions of foster youth in the Santa Cruz area. In fact, 61 local youth were involved in&#160;the planning process.&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several other UC Santa Cruz students and alumni were also involved in the exhibition, including Collegiate Fellows of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s </span><a href="https://smithsociety.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smith Renaissance Society</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which provides a sense of belonging, academic support, social and financial assistance to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">UC Santa Cruz students lacking family guidance, including current and former foster youth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Smith Society</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> provides a pathway to admission for these students, offers support while they are attending UC Santa Cruz, and maintains a growing network of &#8220;Senior Fellows&#8221; after they graduate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three Smith Society collegiate fellows serve as docents for the show, and have provided information to thousands of visitors since the exhibition launched in July, said Shawn Cervantes (Oakes, '13, psychology), Smith Society lead volunteer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the exhibition organizers is another alumna, Jamie Lee Evans (Kresge &#8217;89, sociology), director of training at the California Youth Connection (CYC), a youth-led organization that develops leaders who are helping to transform the foster care system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Organizers and contributors say the exhibit, the longest-running show that MAH has ever had in its largest gallery, offers a vivid and intimate look at a population that is all too often stereotyped and stigmatized. In &#8220;Come Closer,&#8221; an HD video and audio installation by Nada</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#160;Miljkovic (MFA '09, digital arts and new media), former foster children defy labeling by sharing their stories of identity and survival. The video shows their faces in close-up, their eyes gazing directly at the viewer. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One interview subject, only identified as Tiffany, spoke of her endless struggle to &#8220;fit into my environment&#8221; in various households. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I didn&#8217;t feel pretty,&#8217;&#8217; Tiffany said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t feel smart. I was not encouraged to go to a four-year university. That was really hurtful, that they didn&#8217;t believe in me.&#8221; But Tiffany&#8217;s tone changes later in the interview. &#8220;There is a light at the end of the tunnel,&#8217;&#8217; she said. &#8220;You are in charge of your own happiness.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miguel, another interview subject in &#8220;Come Closer,&#8217;&#8217; commented about the ways that intact, healthy families empower children to make their own mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When you are in the foster care system, they are not going to let you make your own mistakes,&#8221; said Miguel, who serves on the CYC&#8217;s board of directors. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have parents a lot of the time. We already don&#8217;t have power. We don&#8217;t have the power to make our own mistakes and make our own successes, and then we get dinged for not having that power to begin with.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The themes of hope, despair, making your own future, and fighting back against stereotyping also come into play in &#8220;Interwoven Voices,&#8221; an installation by Melody Overstreet (Oakes '10, art and psychology).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This artwork is made with drywall tape, linen, strips of paper, and ink. On each strip is a hand-written testimonial, plea, or bold statement from a foster youth that participated in Overstreet&#8217;s project. &#8220;Don&#8217;t criminalize us,&#8221; one paper strip reads. Other strips have brief and urgent messages: &#8220;Don&#8217;t label me,&#8221; &#160;&#8220;We are not bad kids; we are going through bad times,&#8221; and &#8220;Try seeing the world through the lens of foster youth.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Smith Society is hosting &#8220;A Night at the MAH&#8221; at the museum on Thursday, October 12, at 7 p.m. The event includes the opportunity to tour &#8220;Lost Childhoods&#8221; and meet some of the artists and students who created the exhibition. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This fundraiser will benefit the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Page and Eloise Smith Scholarship Endowment, which supports Smith collegiate fellows with financial awards to pay for tuition and related expenses. If you would like to be added to the guest list for this event, please email Shawn Cervantes at <span>skcervan@ucsc.edu</span></span></p>

<p>Now in its fourth year at UC Santa Cruz, the project was inspired by a collection of photographs taken in 1952 by American Army Captain, Charles Eugene Gail. The collection was donated to the University Library&#8217;s Special Collections in 2013 by Gail&#8217;s daughter, Geri, a former UCSC staff member, who felt the best home for the images would be in an educational setting.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to share these pictures of Okinawa with the students at UCSC to perhaps help them learn more about the country and its history,&#8221; said Gail. &#8220;I felt it was important that people learn about the suffering of these people during and after World War II.&#8221;</p>
<p>The photos were taken during an era when the expansion of U.S. military bases on the war-ravaged island was just beginning to accelerate. They document a way of life that would soon disappear--a last glimpse before the presence of thousands of military personnel changed the face and culture of Okinawa.</p>
<p>&#8220;1953 was the last year of the Korean War, and the American military was just realizing Okinawa would be a key location for American bases,&#8221; said UC Santa Cruz history professor Alan Christy, director of the Gail Project.</p>
<p>&#8220;Up until 1953, the new American base emphasis had been in mainland Japan. Okinawa before then was known as &#8216;The Rock&#8217;--it was a place where they sent people, a place of exile. After 1953, it became the &#8216;keystone of the Pacific&#8217;--the most important set of U.S. military bases in the region.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because all of the Gail negatives were lost, the library carefully scanned each photo to ensure the images would be properly preserved. Fifty of these digital prints from the original 200 black and white photos will be on display at <em>The Gail Project: An Okinawan-American Dialogue</em>, a new exhibition running October 5 through December 2 at the Mary Porter Sesnon Gallery on the UC Santa Cruz campus.</p>
<p>The exhibit includes an accompanying digital web archive made up of photos, documents, and oral histories from both American and Okinawan voices, plus student research and writing.</p>
<p><strong>Six weeks ago, Christy took 11 students</strong> on a 16-day trip to Okinawa. The goal was to enable them to do research on a number of subjects in Okinawa history to provide context for the photos in the exhibition.</p>
<p>&#8220;The photos were taken eight years after the the battle of Okinawa,&#8221; said Christy.&#160; &#8220;So I took them to the places where the battle happened in order to give an emotional context to what they had only read about. They talked to survivors and explored a cave and an area around it where the bones of thousands of people had been found after the battle. The students still found a few bone fragments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Throughout the trip, the students also explored many of the original sites of Gail&#8217;s images and re-photographed them, reflecting the current landscape. These new prints will also be on display at the Sesnon exhibition.</p>
<p>As curator of the exhibition, Sesnon Gallery director Shelby Graham accompanied Christy and his students, working closely with them on the trip.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being in Okinawa in 2017 with a group of UC Santa Cruz students, faculty, and staff was a profound site-specific learning experience,&#8221; said Graham. &#8220;We all witnessed and walked on charged landscapes--simultaneously beautiful and brutal--mixing histories of conflict and displacement. It was an unforgettable and timely research opportunity for everyone.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>While the UC Santa Cruz research team</strong> was in Okinawa, there were heightened concerns about nuclear war on the peninsula--particularly about North Korea targeting Guam and Okinawa with missiles.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the students learned is that the history of Okinawa is essential to understanding what&#8217;s going on today,&#8221; Christy noted. &#8220;The history of the war and post-war is keenly felt in how the people of Okinawa--and the Koreans--view the world today. Entering into negotiations and conversations with people in Okinawa and Korea, ignorant of each country&#8217;s recent history, could result in a fiasco.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We hope our project encourages a broad public dialogue across the Pacific about the past, present, and future of the Okinawan-American relationship,&#8221; he added. &#8220;This exhibition is just the start of this dialogue. We intend to travel the show from here to Okinawa and then to locations including Osaka, Hawaii, Los Angeles, and Sao Paolo.&#8221;</p>

At Katherine Isbister's <a href="https://setlab.ucsc.edu/">Social Emotional Technology Lab</a> at UC Santa Cruz, however, researchers are interested in games that draw players' attention to the world around them and create different ways of engaging with other people.</p>
<p>"My lab is interested in how we can use technology to heighten in-person interactions and engage people with what's around them rather than separating them," said Isbister, a professor of computational media.</p>
<p>One game from Isbister's lab, called <a href="https://setlab.ucsc.edu/scenesampler/">SceneSampler</a>, is among the official game selections to be demonstrated at the <a href="http://www.indiecade.com/2017">2017 IndieCade Festival</a> taking place October 6 to 8 in Los Angeles. Known as the "Sundance of the videogame industry," Indiecade celebrates independent games and is open to the public and the game industry. The SceneSampler demo will be part of IndieCade's signature Night Games event on Friday night.</p>
<p>Isbister will also be joining Michael John, director of UCSC's <a href="https://gpm.soe.ucsc.edu/">Games &amp; Playable Media master's program</a>, on an IndieCade panel to discuss future trends in independent games. Isbister will be talking about the growing use of wearable technology and custom hardware in new games.</p>
<p>"With the whole maker movement, the components and kits for building your own hardware have gotten cheaper and more accessible, so it's a lot easier for independent developers to put together interesting projects with different kinds of controllers," Isbister said. "We offered a class on alternative controllers last year, which got a lot of interest from students, and we built custom components for the game we'll be showing at the festival."</p>
<p>SceneSampler is a collaborative game in which players work in pairs to capture scenes from the festival in an unusual way. One player wears a custom-built old-timey 'camera' with a hidden embedded tablet device, while the other carries a sound sampler that detects ambient noise, which looks like an old-fashioned flash unit. Player teams are given challenges to find a specific kind of scene, such as a silent crowd, and record it by filling up the sampler with ambient noise and taking a snapshot with their camera. They bring their samples back to the game master, who marks their scene on a large map, building up a visualization of the social soundscape of the festival. Players&#8217; images are also uploaded onto social media where people can see these sampled moments from the festival.</p>
<p>"The idea is to get people to move around the festival capturing mementos like a scavenger hunt, and you end up with a photo stream that is a different kind of record of what was happening," Isbister said.

Just this week we&#8217;ve kicked off an initiative celebrating students, faculty and staff who are among the first in their families to attend college, UC Santa Cruz was again named one of the </span><a href="https://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings?rankings=top-50-green-colleges"><span style="font-weight: 400;">greenest schools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the country, and we stepped forward on an exciting new student-housing project that will bring thousands of new beds to campus. Now that&#8217;s an opening week!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To students new to campus, welcome. You made a smart choice. This university is an extraordinary place to pursue your interests&#8212;and to discover new ones. Our students and faculty have diverse backgrounds and interests. Our setting is stunning&#8212;surrounded by redwoods and touched by the ocean&#8212;and recreational opportunities abound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please know that we are dedicated to your success. College life is a big change for many people, so if you need assistance or support, reach out and ask for it. Our </span><a href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu/slug-support/program/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slug Support</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> program is top-notch, as is our </span><a href="https://studentsuccess.ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Division of Student Success</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Faculty and staff here are eager to help you succeed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To returning students and faculty, welcome back. The big news to share is that this summer we wrapped up the </span><a href="http://giving.ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campaign for UC Santa Cruz</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, our first-ever comprehensive fundraising campaign. It went incredibly well, so much so that we closed the campaign six months early, raising more than $335 million! I cannot overstate the positive impact it is having, and will have, on our campus: the rebuilt Hay Barn, renovation of the Quarry Amphitheater, new academic programs and scholarships for students, research and teaching support for faculty, and new cultural programs and archives.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please </span><a href="https://events.ucsc.edu/event/4469"><span style="font-weight: 400;">celebrate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with us Oct. 19 at the newly reopened quarry. The Dean of Students is having a </span><a href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">special kickoff</span></a> <a href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">c</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">o</span><a href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">n</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">c</span><a href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">e</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">r</span><a href="https://deanofstudents.ucsc.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">t</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for students there on Oct. 14!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I'm delighted to begin the year with a new, crucially important campus leader in place: Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/02/cpevc-tromp.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Marlene Tromp</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> joined us in June. She has a track record of working with students, faculty, staff, and is unwavering in support of diversity, educational access, and academic excellence. We also have a new Social Sciences dean, </span><a href="https://news.ucsc.edu/2017/06/mitchell-dean.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Katharyne Mitchell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as well as </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">more than 30 new faculty members across all five academic divisions, a tremendous infusion of new energy, ideas, and expertise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That housing project I mentioned earlier is in its early stages, but it&#8217;s something I am thrilled about. </span><a href="https://ches.ucsc.edu/housing/studenthousingwest/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Student Housing West</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an innovative public-private partnership, will allow us to build 3,000 new beds on the westside of campus. We&#8217;re aiming to have the first ones online in 2020. This will attract more students to campus housing. That will be good for the rental market and for the entire Santa Cruz community.&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our </span><a href="https://firstgen.ucsc.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First Generation Initiative</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, meanwhile, is in full swing. With more than 42 percent of our undergraduates among the first generation in their families to seek a four-year college or university degree, we&#8217;ve proudly launched a program that seeks to support, connect, and highlight first-generation undergraduate and graduate students, as well as faculty, professional staff, and alumni. I&#8217;ll be wearing my First-Gen Grad T-shirt, as will CP/EVC Tromp! We&#8217;re both proud members of that club.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In closing, I must acknowledge the political winds that have been swirling this summer, creating a campus climate very different than when students left for the summer just a few months ago. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Trump has essentially ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, imperiling the futures of hundreds of thousands of undocumented students across our nation, including hundreds here on our campus who are pursuing the dream of a college education without fear of deportation</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Federal officials also have taken aim at Title IX rules that govern sexual harassment and sexual violence on campus. And freedom of speech is now at the fore of the national debate after the horrible incident in Charlottesville, Virginia, and after the reinvigorated activism involving the national anthem at NFL games.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want undocumented students at UC Santa Cruz to know this: You do not stand alone. We are proud of your efforts and recognize your contributions to campus and to society. You are what makes America great, and we will do all in our power to help you and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">to protect your rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CP/EVC Tromp and I also would like to reiterate UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s strong commitment to ending sexual assault and other forms of sexual violence on our campus. Our commitment will not waver despite the troubling decision by the U.S. Secretary of Education to unwind six years of federal enforcement effort aimed at strengthening sexual violence protections on college campuses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, freedom of speech is a fundamental right in America. It allows us to express opinions, no matter how unpopular, and to criticize other views. This freedom is uniquely important to a university, as it brings about a free interchange of ideas integral to teaching, research, and public service. I urge all in our campus community to look at the university as a marketplace of ideas. We grow intellectually by listening to other opinions, sometimes liking them, sometimes rejecting them. But always hearing them. That must unfailingly be part of the equation for us to fulfill our educational mission. The </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">best way to counteract offensive speech is with more speech. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Never has this been more important.</span></p>
