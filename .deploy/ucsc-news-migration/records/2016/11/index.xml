At 15, she caught her first glimpse of wilderness during a Yosemite visit, and now, a decade later, she&#8217;s discovering her passions in the redwoods of UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Vergara, 25, is the first student to transfer to UC Santa Cruz from San Jose City College as a Cultivamos Excelencia Scholar. The two schools have collaborated to receive a $3.2 million U.S. Department of Education Hispanic-Serving Institutions <a href="../../2015/10/hsi-award.xml">grant</a> under the leadership of <a href="http://www.sjcc.edu/academics/academic-programs/metas">Metas Program</a> Director Robert Gutierrez.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re building a nurturing community of emerging Latina and Latino scholars bound for a world-class research experience at a University of California campus,&#8221; SJCC&#8217;s Gutierrez said.</p>
<p>The five-year mission of the Cultivamos Excelencia Project is to motivate and retain Hispanic/Latino and other high-need students at SJCC to complete their bachelor&#8217;s degrees at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through this program, I&#8217;ve learned that Santa Cruz is such a great place for research,&#8221; Vergara says. &#8220;It&#8217;s crazy how many opportunities there are here for environmental research and internships.&#8221;</p>
<p>She got her Wildland Resources and Forestry Certification with Citrus College, worked as a youth educator with Outward Bound Adventures, and volunteered with the Santa Cruz Puma Project. Now, just a few weeks into her first quarter here, she is working as an assistant at Thimann Labs, which has rooftop instructional greenhouses on campus, and she plans to declare a plant science major.</p>
<p>As a Cultivamos Excelencia Scholar at SJCC, Vergara got help with transfer and scholarship applications, and assistance with admission and course planning. She was matched with Katherine Ennis, a Ph.D. research mentor in Environmental Studies at UCSC. The college is in the process of hiring more doctoral students to serve as mentors.</p>
<p>Vergara, the daughter of Mexican immigrants and the only English speaker in her family, is one of 5,567 Hispanic/Latino students offered admission to UC Santa Cruz this fall.</p>
<p>&#8220;Latino/Latina students, who now constitutes a critical mass on our campus&#8212;29 percent in 2013&#8212;bring a wealth of knowledge and skills that are critical for UCSC&#8217;s continued success as a leading public research university in California,&#8221; says Elizabeth Gonzalez, who is leading the partnership and undergraduate research related to the Cultivamos Excelencia grant.</p>
<p>&#8220;The ingenuity they bring is the type of entrepreneurial spirit that Silicon Valley companies look to UCSC to produce,&#8221; Gonzalez said. &#8220;These students promise to make monumental contributions to the labor force and global economy with the same unrelenting value for hard work as many of their immigrant parents.&#8221;</p>
<p>Recently, a group of SJCC student members in the second cohort of Cultivamos Excelencia Scholars visited UC Santa Cruz to tour the McHenry Library and explore its journals and databases essential to research. Each scholar received a library card with comprehensive access through the remainder of the academic year.</p>
<p>Among them was Veronica Garcia, one of the 21 scholars enrolled in the program, who talked about the struggles she&#8217;s had as a first-generation college student. Her first tries at community college ended with her dropping out to work and raise her daughter, now 11.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t feel like I had what it would take in school, and I was struggling to keep up with classes and life,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Keeping a job, raising my daughter, and helping out my family was a priority.&#8221;</p>
<p>Garcia didn&#8217;t give up on school, though, and she expresses gratitude for the support she&#8217;s gotten so she can someday become a behavioral psychologist.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#160;am truly blessed to be where I am today in life and for all the little things life has brought me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I am meant to be here, now, in this present moment.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="263c89188072701752a34ca3dcc973fa"><name>computational-media</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz now offering graduate degrees in computational media</title><summary>Department of Computational Media is accepting applications now for the M.S. and Ph.D. programs to begin in fall 2017.</summary><keywords>Computational Media, Games and Playable Media, computer game design, Noah Wardrip-Fruin, Michael Mateas, Katherine Isbister</keywords><start-date>1478156400000</start-date><display-name>UCSC now offering graduate degrees in computational media</display-name><path>/2016/11/computational-media</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/11/computational-media</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1478110249955</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1478187750976</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Engineering</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name><value>Computational Media</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Silicon Valley</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/11/images/cave-lab-410.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/11/images/cave-lab-410.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cave-lab-410.jpg</name><display-name>cave-lab-410.jpg</display-name><file-size>86778</file-size><width>410</width><height>322</height></image><image-alt>students interacting with virtual reality environment</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/11/images/cave-lab-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/11/images/cave-lab-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>cave-lab-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>cave-lab-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20633</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>students interacting with virtual reality environment</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Computational media facilities at UCSC include the CAVE Lab for creating three-dimensional virtual environments that multiple users can interact with at the same time.

The <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/departments/computational-media">Department of Computational Media</a> in UCSC's <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/">Baskin School of Engineering</a> is accepting <a href="http://graddiv.ucsc.edu/prospective-students/">applications</a> now for the M.S. and Ph.D. programs to begin in fall 2017.</p>
<p>Examples of computational media include video games, smartphone applications, social media, and virtual-reality experiences. As a field of study, computational media involves research in design and technology, as well as interpretive analysis of mediated experiences and digital humanities research.</p>
<p>"Computational media is a broad umbrella, with applications ranging from art and entertainment to health interventions and education. Our program integrates the creation of breakthrough technologies for media with interdisciplinary knowledge about how media are crafted and understood," said professor of computational media Noah Wardrip-Fruin.</p>
<p>"Computation and media are increasingly intertwined in the commercial world, and these skill sets are very much in demand," added Katherine Isbister, professor of computational media. "Also, as a culture, we need to better understand the impact of computational media on society and on us, so we need people thinking deeply about that and producing work that gets more of us thinking about it."</p>
<p>The new graduate programs will target students who already have significant knowledge in at least one of the related areas, such as a bachelor's degree in computer science or work experience as an artist or designer in the computer game industry, Wardrip-Fruin said. The Computational Media Department currently offers a bachelor's degree in computer game design and a professional master's degree in games and playable media.</p>
<p><strong>Top program</strong></p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz has developed one of the country's top programs in this field, led by highly regarded faculty such as Wardrip-Fruin, Isbister, Jim Whitehead, and Michael Mateas, department chair and director of UCSC's <a href="https://games.soe.ucsc.edu/">Center for Games and Playable Media</a>. The campus was the first in the UC system to offer an undergraduate degree in computer game design in 2006. The Department of Computational Media was established in 2014, focusing on the development, use, and understanding of new media technologies.</p>
<p>"Computational media combines computer science with the arts and humanities, and I think we are arguably the best place in the world for students who want to break new ground in this area," said Wardrip-Fruin.</p>
<p>Isbister noted that the program has grown organically out of the work of the faculty, who have helped define the emerging field of computational media. "Both the professors and the students who work with them are already articulating the field and building exemplars of where we can go with it," she said.</p>
<p>The curriculum for the computational media graduate programs at UC Santa Cruz will have enough flexibility to allow different students to identify their interests and find the right mix of courses for them. At the same time, the programs provide a framework that guarantees students will have adequate baseline knowledge and training in all the relevant areas and will be able operate at a high level in technical, creative, and interpretive modes.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Strong market</strong></p>
<p>There is a strong market for graduates with advanced degrees in this field, Wardrip-Fruin said. A wide variety of jobs are available for professionals with combined knowledge of technology and media at large companies such as Apple and Facebook, as well as at other companies involved in games, phone and tablet apps, and social media. There are also a growing number of academic positions for research faculty studying games and other computational media.</p>
<p>In the past, graduate students at UC Santa Cruz who were interested in computational media have earned degrees in computer science or digital arts and new media. The professional M.S. degree in games and playable media, which prepares students for jobs in the fast-growing game industry, has been offered at UCSC's Silicon Valley Center since 2013. The Computational Media Department is planning to offer additional professional master's degrees, in serious games and human-computer interaction, at the Silicon Valley site in the near future.</p>

A part of the UC Santa Cruz sociology program, the Everett Program merges the enthusiasm of student leaders with information technology to promote social change by building social networking capacity across non-governmental and community-based organizations. <br/>
 <br/>
 A group of students recently spent the weekend collaborating with Motivating Individual Leadership for Public Advancement (MILPA), a nonprofit in Salinas dedicated to youth empowerment. <br/>
 <br/>
 The weekend was modelled after a hackathon, an event that brings together computer programmers, developers, designers, coders, and others to work together in a condensed timeframe to create usable software. Instead of focusing on technology, Everett&#8217;s impactathon aligns to the program&#8217;s mission of empowering people to develop practical solutions to persistent problems. <br/>
 <br/>
 Six students met up with 30 MILPA youth volunteers, which included middle schoolers, high schoolers, and community college students, at the organization&#8217;s Salinas office to create a set of educational materials that would amplify MILPA &#8220;schools not prisons&#8221; message to voters. <br/>
 <br/>
 In two short days, the group created a set of infographics, posters, and even door hangers to raise awareness about who California sends to prison, what the cost is to taxpayers, and how that affects investments in education, health and other community needs. <br/>
<h2>Community building</h2>
California&#8217;s incarceration problem and the school-to-prison pipeline is a personal issue at MILPA. Some of the organization&#8217;s staff members are transitioning back into the community after spending their childhood and adult lives incarcerated or in a detention system, while others were once considered at-risk youths themselves. <br/>
 <br/>
 They have seen the prison problem first hand and want to make a difference. <br/>
 <br/>
 For MILPA co-founder John Pineda, youth involvement in the political process is vital step towards mobilizing change. Raising awareness about how legislation impacts young people's lives is one way to connect them to the political system, he said.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;I think what made this impactathon so meaningful for us is that we were working on an issue that we all care deeply about,&#8221; said Christine Ongjoco (Cowell &#8217;16, sociology), an Everett Program graduate&#160; who now is a staff support fellow. &#8220;There was so much passion and energy in the room being able to create an immediate impact,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Doing it with new friends made getting things done fun.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 The impactathon not only highlighted the different ways problems can be presented, it also gave local youth the opportunity to talk in their own voice about problems they experience. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Young people are never brought to the table to discuss how they are feeling,&#8221; said Pineda. His 13-year-old daughter, Jennifer, participated in the impactathon and even created her own infographic that questions why the state allocates more money to prisons than to preventative measures like early childhood education. &#160;<br/>
<h2>Overcoming the digital divide</h2>
Impactathons are also an opportunity to demystify technology in a fun and engaging way, said Ongjoco. During the first part of the program, MILPA volunteers learned about graphic design and how to use open-source infographic makers. The second half focused on learning by doing and team workshops.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;It was amazing to see the progress people made, of all ages and tech experiences,&#8221; Ongjoco said.<br/>
 <br/>
 Everett Program students also supplied loaner laptops for MILPA volunteers to use. &#8220;There is still a digital divide,&#8221; said Pineda. He also pointed out that there is also not just a lack of resources but also a gap in equity and education.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Just the term graphic design seems so foreign, that only certain people can access,&#8221; he said. For the youth he works with, doing graphic design was something they never thought they could do. Thanks to working with Everett Program students, now they can.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;It was so cool seeing them put their designs on their school binders,&#8221; said Pineda. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Our community partners are finding them to be a great opportunity to not only move forward very specific projects, but also expand their own technology capacities,&#8221; said Everett Program director Chris Benner.<br/>
 <br/>
 This is the second impactathon the Everett Program has organized. The first was to create graphic design collateral for No Place Like Home, a project on the Santa Cruz housing crisis organized by sociology professors Steve McKay and Miriam Greenberg.</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://www.everettprogram.org/</url><title>Everett Program</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="2ce60e418072701752a34ca3ad87b3c0"><name>hunicke-ted-women</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>UC Santa Cruz’s Robin Hunicke shares the spotlight at TEDWomen </title><summary>Robin Hunicke, director of art and design in the Games and Playable Media program at UC Santa Cruz, showcased her innovative work at a gathering of TEDWomen Experience.</summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, ucsc, Robin Hunicke, Luna, UCSC Games and Playable Media</keywords><start-date>1478223600000</start-date><display-name>UC Santa Cruz’s Robin Hunicke shares the spotlight at TEDWomen </display-name><path>/2016/11/hunicke-ted-women</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/11/hunicke-ted-women</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1478222022651</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1478227323225</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Arts</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Admissions</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Staff</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>International</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/11/images/hunicke-cr-lauren-iverson-375.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/11/images/hunicke-cr-lauren-iverson-375.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hunicke-cr-lauren-iverson-375.jpg</name><display-name>hunicke-cr-lauren-iverson-375.jpg</display-name><file-size>103110</file-size><width>375</width><height>269</height></image><image-alt>Robin Hunicke, director of art and design in the Games and Playable Media program at UC Sa</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/11/images/hunicke-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/11/images/hunicke-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>hunicke-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>hunicke-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>21033</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Robin Hunicke, director of art and design in the Games and Playable Media program at UC Sa</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Robin Hunicke, director of art and design in the Games and Playable Media program at UC Santa Cruz (Photo by Lauren Iverson)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Robin Hunicke, director of art and design in the Games and Playable Media program at UC Santa Cruz, showcased her innovative work at a gathering of TEDWomen Experience participants last week.</p>

<p>The startups ranged from a gaming company that uses virtual reality to help people overcome trauma, to an exoskeleton that lets people with disabilities transcend their wheelchairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;These women are part of a great and inspiring community of innovators and entrepreneurs from UC,&#8221; said Christine Gulbranson, UC&#8217;s senior vice president for research innovation and entrepreneurship, who hosted the event.&#160;&#8220;Their research and resultant products demonstrate the incredible positive impact UC entrepreneurs are making in the world."</p>
<p>Hunicke, the CEO and cofounder of San Francisco-based indie game studio Funomena, showcased <em>Luna</em>, a virtual reality experience that was inspired by a dream.</p>
<p>A prominent advocate of the Intentional Play movement--aimed at inspiring developers to create games that have a larger purpose beyond just entertainment--Hunicke has been creating games for more

<p>There, in an octagonal room with views of the bay, 16 members of the UC Santa Cruz Kendo Club&#8212;some of them dressed in dark jackets and wide pants that make them appear as if they are floating across the padded floor&#8212;are at practice.&#160;</p>
<p>They lift their bamboo swords called <em>shinai</em> and slash at the air. They bark out calls and stamp their feet as part of a martial art that was developed in Japan centuries before.</p>
<p>It is a noisy, physically demanding sport that focuses on improving oneself and one&#8217;s technique, on teamwork, and contributing to society&#8212;and is a complement to the rigors of university study, several club members say.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is about overcoming your own smallness,&#8221; says Tyler Oku, a 22-year-old history major at College Ten who helped found the club four years earlier. &#8220;It&#8217;s about overcoming that voice in your head that says you can&#8217;t do this; it&#8217;s about overcoming with a strong heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In kendo, there is discipline. You honor your sensei,&#8221; says Yutaka Tokunaga, using the Japanese word for martial arts teacher. The 19-year-old incoming president of the club was born in Japan and is studying computer engineering. &#8220;Sensei give their time to teach us, and we have to honor that.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the same way, the Oakes College student who expects to graduate in 2020 honors his professors. &#8220;They could be doing other, more important things,&#8221; Tokunaga says, &#8220;but they are teaching us, and so you give them respect.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Oku, kendo is an ancient martial art that grew out of the swordsmanship used by Japanese warriors centuries ago. Modern practitioners use &#8220;swords&#8221; called <em>shinai,</em> which are made up of four long bamboo slats held together with leather fittings. The <em>shinai</em> are used to strike an opponent&#8217;s arms, head, and upper body, which are covered with armor made out of plastic or bamboo. Each &#8220;hit&#8221; is accompanied by a slap of the foot and a shout, which names the body part about to be struck.</p>
<p>The strike, shout, and foot stomp are meant to be simultaneous and precise, or what is called <em>Ki Ken Tai Ichi</em>, says Oku. In competition, any hesitation or deviation from specific moves are penalized.</p>
<p>&#8220;A good, clean hit should look beautiful,&#8221; Oku says of the discipline required by the sport. &#8220;It shouldn&#8217;t look like some guy just flipping out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sitting outside the martial arts room on a warm fall evening, Oku says kendo is not only a strenuous workout but also helps develop character.</p>
<p>&#8220;On a physical level you can be pushed to do more than you thought you could do and there is also a culture of teamwork and camaraderie.&#8221;</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Kendo Club practices twice a week and competes only in one event, the Yuhihai Intercollegiate Kendo Tournament in Los Angeles. But kendo is not just about competition, Oku says.</p>
<p>One of the martial art&#8217;s underlying principles is that &#8220;you work diligently and try to make progress,&#8221; Oku says. &#8220;Similarly, you try to develop how you can contribute to society.&#8221;</p>
<p>Oku began studying kendo in middle school as did Tokunaga, whose father is a sensei in the martial art.</p>
<p>Sabrina Tran, a 19-year-old linguistics major at Merrill College, says she studied kendo as an exchange student in Japan and joined the club because she was nostalgic for her study-abroad experience and because the sport is a good way to de-stress from her studies.</p>
<p>She took her place next to Oku, who led the group in warm-up exercises, then took club members through footwork drills. Students frowned in concentration, their <em>shinai</em> at arms&#8217; length in front of them, their quick gliding steps whispering across the floor.</p>
<p>Oku watched as some of the participants&#8217; <em>shinai</em> bobbed up and down.</p>

<p>The Black Panther Party was officially formed in 1966, shortly after the creation of Marvel&#8217;s Black Panther character. Looking back after 50 years, two interconnected exhibits will examine the role of women in the Party and the comic.&#160;</p>
<p>Thirty photographs by <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/10/jones-baruch-gift.html"><strong><em>Pirkle Jones and Ruth-Marion Baruch</em></strong></a>, ephemera, and original posters by Emory Douglas comprise one part of the exhibit. Forty-five comics, portraying the Black Panther character and African Americans in the second half of the 20th Century, form the other.</p>
<p>There is also a digital component to the exhibit that includes supplementary pictorial materials and essays by each of the curators, addressing roles of women and children in the Black Panther Party and the comic.</p>
<p>The curators--crystal am nelson, Cathy Thomas, and Kiran Garcha--are all Ph.D. students at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>A comic book about the <em>Black Panther</em> comic, commissioned and created to accompany the exhibit, will be available to visitors free of charge.</p>
<p>The exhibition runs through April 1, 2017.</p>

Alex succumbed to the injuries she suffered in a "hit and run" traffic accident on Sunday, October 30, 2016 in Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>Alex was from Lawndale, California and came to UCSC in fall 2014. She was a junior majoring in Theater Arts. Alex was a vibrant member of our community, sharing her talents with our academic community as a course assistant last year and tutor this quarter.</p>
<p>Please join us in expressing our deep condolences to Alex's family and friends. We will notify you of plans for a memorial service as soon as they are available.</p>

<p>"Many of the social and political issues that students care about are on the ballot and this election is high stakes thus producing high-stress feelings for many," Assistant Vice Provost for Student Success Pablo Reguerin said. "We encourage students to come together, in community, to watch and participate/support this historic election.</p>
<p>"This is an important time to come together, dialogue and peacefully engage in the many complex issues before us. Practice and encourage others to practice self-care throughout this process."</p>
<p>Six campus polling stations will be open on Tuesday, November 8, from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. All will accept mail-in ballots. In addition, people may deposit their completed ballot in a new Official Ballot Drop Box that has been installed in Quarry Plaza in front of Bay Tree Bookstore.</p>
<p>Students will get together at the following places to watch the results:</p>
<ul>
<li>College Nine and College Ten Rec Lounge, 5 p.m.&#8211;late</li>

<p>The Banana Slugs will play Pomona-Pitzer on Saturday at Burns Stadium in Claremont.</p>
<p>The Banana Slugs were selected from Pool B, which consists of independent institutions, as well as members of conferences that do not meet the requirements for automatic qualification. The women&#8217;s soccer team was qualified after beating Mills College 10&#8211;0 on Saturday.</p>
<p>UCSC went 6&#8211;10&#8211;1 on the year, but was 5&#8211;4 against Division III institutions, better than any other independent. The Banana Slugs&#8217; tough schedule this year included five Division II opponents.</p>
<p>The team will have a rematch against Pomona-Pitzer on Saturday. The Slugs fell 3&#8211;0 at the Sagehens in the second game of the season. Claremont-Mudd-Scripps takes on NWC champion Pacific Lutheran in the other half of the West Coast subregional.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>At only 19, &#160;Jimenez&#8217;s efforts are already being recognized: She is the 2016 recipient of the prestigious Women in Green Forum Youth Trailblazer Award.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Every year, the Women In Green Forum Steering Committee recognizes a young environmental leader who is making an impact in the areas of climate change, sustainable development, and human rights. In addition to honoring Jimenez this year, labor rights leader, Dolores Huerta was also recognized. Huerta co-founded the National Farmworkers Association which later became the United Farm Workers.&#160;<br/>
</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;To me, this award isn&#8217;t something that &#8216;I won&#8217;, this award is holding me accountable to continue my work to keep fighting not just for the people, but with the people,&#8221; Jimenez said.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>For more than half her life, Jimenez has been committed to solving environmental issues. This commitment continues at UC Santa Cruz, where she serves an academic mentor and a volunteer with the</span> <a href="http://kresge.ucsc.edu/activities/coops/garden-coop.html"><span>Kresge Garden Co-op</span></a><span>. She also serves as the fiscal co-chair and carbon fund representative for</span> <a href="http://eslp.enviroslug.org"><span>the Education for Sustainable Living Program</span></a><span>, a student-run organization that offers student-facilitated discussion and research projects for credit every spring quarter. She even helped bring co-founder of the activist group The Yes Men, Igor Vamos, to campus.&#160;<br/>
</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>There are many issues that Jimenez is troubled by&#8212;and they are all connected, she says. At the age of 8, Jimenez moved from San Pablo City in the Philippines to Highland Park in Los Angeles.&#160;<br/>
</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;I came from a tropical forest to a parking lot,&#8221; she remembers about arriving to her new home, a low-income and marginalized neighborhood.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;The streets were dirty and there were no trees.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>So Jimenez organized community cleanups and tree adoptions. She lobbied for the environment at the California State Capitol. She attended a Climate Reality Leadership Training led by Al Gore with the Alliance for Climate Education. She started a plot in a community garden that she donated to Franklin High School. She also created the School Alliance Committee, a group that aims to connect high schoolers with the local neighborhood council and surrounding community.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>But Jimenez feels that is not enough. She wants to see more youth actively engaged in community issues that affect them.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;Youth voices are not in political spaces,&#8221; she says, adding that young people have the potential to be a mobilizing force.&#160;<br/>
</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;Their voice is powerful because it is not expected.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Next summer, she&#8217;ll organize a youth leadership institute for sophomores and juniors at her former high school. She hopes to bring together local community activist groups with students to open a dialogue for community change.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>In the meantime, Jimenez is busy as a residential assistant in Kresge College, where she involves her residents in programs and campus life.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;This award is a reminder that as young leader, I need to remember that it isn't about what I have obtained, but about what I have done for others to obtain greater./"</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://womeningreenforum.com/awardees/</url><title>Women

What classes will I take? How should I spend my time? What will the future bring?</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz audio storytelling project&#160;<a href="https://soundcloud.com/ucsantacruz/sets/storycruz">StoryCruz</a> posed these questions to a group of students who were studying outside and enjoying a sunny fall day at Cowell College.</p>
<p>Thoughtful and adventurous, the students had interesting stories to tell. Different paths and motivations brought them to UC Santa Cruz, but each had found his or her place here.</p>
<p>Andrea Block, for instance, has a "triple nationality," having lived in Canada and Spain before coming to the United States. She already feels right at home on campus. "It's like paradise," she remarked.</p>
<p>Block was sitting next to her friend Brian Buckley, who also comes from far away. He was born in Warsaw, Poland, but grew up in California. He's now holding on to his multicultural side by joining Model United Nations UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>When StoryCruz caught up with Galen Turoci, a computer science/game design major, he was just about to set out for his favorite class on campus: aikido, a martial arts practice that helps him unwind. Turoci, who hails from Riverside, also relaxes by making his way across the wooded and hilly campus on foot. Martial arts plays a strong role in his life. "It is as much spiritual as it is physical," he said.</p>
<p>Another Cowell student, Miranda Barbiere, said UC Santa Cruz is "pretty perfect" for her. She comes from Orange County and is studying art. She had visited Santa Cruz before with family as part of a grand tour of the UC campuses.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="467a90738072701752a34ca3b2928f06"><name>fairlie-bulman</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>How big does a lottery jackpot have to be to boost college attendance?</title><summary>To better understand the connection between parental resources and college attendance you might start by looking at lottery winners.</summary><start-date>1478651400000</start-date><display-name>Lottery wins and college attendance</display-name><path>/2016/11/fairlie-bulman</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/11/fairlie-bulman</link><created-by>lasnier</created-by><created-on>1478651185974</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1478652813717</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Social Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name><value>Economics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Staff</value><value>Parents and Family</value><value>Donors</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Alumni</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Melissa De Witte</name><title></title><phone/><email>mdewitte@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/11/images/fairlie-bulman-350.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/11/images/fairlie-bulman-350.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>fairlie-bulman-350.jpg</name><display-name>fairlie-bulman-350.jpg</display-name><file-size>46548</file-size><width>350</width><height>210</height></image><image-alt>rob fairlie and george bulman</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/11/images/lotto-80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/11/images/lotto-80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>lotto-80.jpg</name><display-name>lotto-80.jpg</display-name><file-size>8751</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>lotto balls</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Economics professors Rob Fairlie, left, and George Bulman.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead>First study using tax returns of lottery winners  looks at how one-time income gains affects college outcomes</article-subhead><article-text><p dir="ltr"><span>To better understand the connection between parental resources and college attendance you might start by looking at lottery winners.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w22679"><span>In a new working paper</span></a> <span>published through the</span> <span>National Bureau of Economic Research</span><span>, UC Santa Cruz economics professors George Bulman and Rob Fairlie explore how resources and school decisions correlate by examining more than 1 million children of state lottery winners.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>To determine if additional household resources influenced college outcomes, Bulman and Fairlie matched federal tax records from parents who won the lottery to the financial aid records of college students, factoring in time and size of jackpots.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>They found that modest wins of $10,000 to $30,000 had little effect on college attendance. Even winning $30,000 to $100,000, a sum that would make the costs of in-state tuition at a four-year public university tenable, made no real difference. The percentage point estimate was close to zero.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>It was the large wins that saw the larger impact on university enrollment.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Wins between $100,000 to $300,000 raised attendance between 1 to 2 percentage points and wins of $300,000 to $1 million increased attendance by 5 to 6 percentage points. But if a family won $1 million or more, attendance at a four-year college shot up by 10 percentage points.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The economists also accounted for the influence of a lottery win on financial aid packages and borrowing constraints. Even if a student would have been eligible for financial aid before their family won the lottery, it made no difference to their attendance decision.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;While a reduction in financial aid is the natural byproduct of winning the lottery, whatever crowd-out is occurring is not altering children&#8217;s attendance decisions,&#8221; the economists write.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The study, co-authored with Serena Goodman from the Federal Reserve Bank and Department of Treasury's Adam Isen, is also the first to use the universe of lottery winnings from tax records to study income effect on any outcome.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The authors also explored how winning the lottery influenced other financial decisions, including homeownership and employment. Bulman and Fairlie looked at how a family managed personal finances after a win, such as savings, mortgages, and investments.&#160;<br/>
</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;The effects of additional income for investment in homeownership are more nuanced: for those without a mortgage prior to winning, there is an increase in having a mortgage</span> <span>at every win level</span><span>,&#8221; the authors write. &#8220;For those with a mortgage already, it appears that households use large winnings to pay it off.&#8221;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Bulman and Fairlie also address implication for policy design, suggesting that educational investment might benefit from a reduction in college costs and an increase in value families place on college.<br/>

Many of us are struggling this morning to reconcile the outcome of the vote with the values we hold close.<br/>
 <br/>
 More than 2,000 students marched peacefully across campus last night, expressing their shock and outrage. Many members of the campus community feel uneasy and perhaps unsafe in the wake of campaign rhetoric that targeted so many populations, including undocumented immigrants, Muslims, people of color, people with disabilities, women, and survivors of sexual assault. <br/>
 <br/>
 It will take time to fully process this news. Feelings of disbelief, anxiety, and grief are real. If it's any comfort, we are not alone; the shock waves are rippling across the country and around the world.<br/>
 <br/>
 The question this morning is how we cope. This is a time to hold each other with respect, and dig deep to support one another. There will be time later for us to strategize how to respond to the challenges we as a university may face.<br/>
 <br/>
 We are grateful for the UC Santa Cruz community, where dedicated staff and faculty are coming together to support students and one another. The link below provides highlights of some of the resources the campus is providing, including spaces today where we can debrief together on the election and the national climate that fostered this outcome. <br/>
 <br/>
 Today, even more than yesterday, we must continue the difficult conversations, find our voices, listen conscientiously to different viewpoints, and find a way to move forward together, united by our commitment to inclusivity, equality, and compassion. <br/>

 <br/>
 One of those exhibitions, <em>I'm Walkin' For my Freedom: The Selma March for Voting Rights</em>, featured historical photographs from renowned photojournalist Matt Herron, documenting a significant moment in the Civil Rights movement in Alabama that led directly to the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/>
 <br/>
 Herron covered the Civil Rights struggle for the top magazines of the era--including <em>Life, Look, Time</em> and <em>Newsweek</em>, and he won the World Press Photo Contest for civil rights photography in 1965.<br/>
 <br/>
 Delaveaga Elementary School teacher Antonio Romero noted the importance of teaching students about voting rights in the United States. <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;We decided to capitalize on this election year through our curriculum which teaches about the U.S. government,&#8221; said Romero. &#8220;We discussed that it&#8217;s your right to vote and also your responsibility, and how we as citizens have the power to effect change.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;We have a diverse community and also feel it&#8217;s essential to highlight the struggle and the history,&#8221; he added. &#8220;When the Constitution was written, not everyone was allowed to vote.&#8221; <br/>
 <br/>
 Shelby Graham, director of the Mary Porter Sesnon Gallery, led interactive discussions with groups of students about the photographs on display. She pointed to one particular photo&#8212;depicting a lone child protester holding up a sign.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Many students found that to be their favorite photo in the exhibit,&#8221; said Graham. &#8220;They saw an 8-year-old child--just a few years younger than they are--who was willing to risk getting arrested by holding up a &#8216;register to vote&#8217; sign,&#8221; said Graham.<br/>
 <br/>
 Romero noted that his students had very strong opinions about the candidates in the 2016 presidential election. <br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 &#8220;My goal is not to influence what they think, but just to make them think,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I teach them to develop an argument and back it up with evidence.&#8221; <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;Voting rights were not talked about when I was in elementary school,&#8221; he added. &#8220;There has been a struggle in our country&#8217;s history and it&#8217;s still continuing today.&#8221;<br/>
 <br/>
 In fact, just three years ago, the Supreme Court invalidated the core of the Voting Rights Act of 1965--freeing nine states to change their election laws without advance federal approval--on the grounds that times had changed and this protection was no longer necessary. <br/>
 <br/>
 But recent lawsuits and revelations the past few months about voter suppression efforts have shown that racial discrimination still persists in 2016.<br/>
 <br/>
 &#8216;I&#8217;m glad the students came on Election Day,&#8221; Graham observed. Every one of them had an &#8216;I voted&#8217; sticker because they did a mock election in their class.&#8221; <br/>
 <br/>
 &#8220;I asked them if they had any difficulty in registering to vote in their classroom,&#8221; Graham added. &#8220;They said no--they were surprised that anyone would ever have trouble registering to vote.&#8221; <br/>
 &#160; <br/>

Stranded as a week-old pup, she was rescued and rehabilitated by the Monterey Bay Aquarium, then released into the wild, only to encounter one difficulty after another, including a severe shark bite, poisoning from toxic prey, and getting lost offshore.</p>
<p>After multiple cycles of stranding, rehabilitation, and release, Selka was deemed unreleasable by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). In 2014, she joined Colleen Reichmuth's research program at Long Marine Lab, where she helped graduate student Sarah McKay Strobel study how sea otters find their prey.</p>
<p>"We actually don't know anything about how sea otters find food underwater. We know what they eat because they consume their food at the surface, but they spend a lot of time diving and we really don't know what they're doing down there," said Reichmuth, who directs the <a href="http://pinnipedlab.ucsc.edu/">Pinniped Cognition and Sensory Systems Laboratory</a>.</p>
<p>Working with Selka has helped the scientists learn how sea otters use their senses to find and identify things underwater (turns out she has a keen sense of touch, with both paws and whiskers). Selka also helped the researchers develop field methods for studying foraging behavior in wild otters.</p>
<p>She is now back at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, being evaluated as a possible surrogate mother for orphaned sea otter pups. Meanwhile, other sea otters are helping scientists at Long Marine Lab understand why so many pups are being abandoned in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>Sea otter metabolism</strong></p>
<p>Terrie Williams, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, and postdoctoral researcher Nicole Thometz are working with the aquarium's sea otter program to study how much metabolic energy it takes for a female sea otter to rear a pup. The answer is a lot, so much that some otter moms can't find enough food in the wild to sustain themselves and their growing pup.</p>
<p>"The amount of food those females need to get a pup from birth to weaning is so enormous, conditions in the wild have to be perfect. And in some areas of Monterey Bay, there just isn't enough prey for them. That's a major reason why pups are being abandoned," Williams said. "We wouldn't know this without being able to study them at our lab. It has changed how we think about abandoned pups after they're rehabilitated. Should they go back into that same environment, or should we be putting them in more productive areas to give them a fighting chance?"</p>
<p>Some of the animals Williams works with can be returned to the wild after participating in the research program. That's the plan for a pregnant female known only as "Old Lady." Around 13 years old, she was brought in by the aquarium with a horrific facial wound, inflicted by a male during mating, which left her unable to eat and likely unable to survive in the wild.</p>
<p>When an exam revealed Old Lady's pregnancy, Williams and her team agreed to help with the rehabilitation and support the pregnant otter through the birth and weaning of her pup. In the process, they have been measuring her metabolism and caloric demands each week to better understand what sea otter moms in the wild need. Like an expectant family, Williams and her team are now anxiously awaiting the birth of the pup.</p>
<p>"Our hope is to release Old Lady with her pup as soon as it's weaned," Williams said. "We want to release animals in a way that's consistent with their best chance at survival."</p>
<p><strong>Long-term residents</strong></p>
<p>Some animals just aren't able to make it in the wild, though, and have become long-term residents and research partners at the lab. For now, Long Marine Lab's resident animals are in temporary quarters during a major renovation of the marine mammal pools. Many of them are living at aquariums and at the California Department of Fish and Wildlife's Marine Mammal Veterinary Care and Research Center, located nearby on the UCSC Coastal Science Campus.</p>
<p>A Hawaiian monk seal named Kekoa is among those temporarily housed at the state wildlife facility. An adult male nine feet long, Kekoa was <a href="http://www.fpir.noaa.gov/DIR/dir_KE18home.html">removed from the wild</a> because he was attacking monk seal pups and young females. The Hawaiian monk seal is one of the most endangered marine mammals in the world, with only about 1,100 left in the wild, so the loss of any pup or female is a serious blow to the species.</p>
<p>"Kekoa was so destructive to the population, there were few choices for him," Williams said. "I agreed to take care of him sight unseen. I was nervous about it, but my fears were unfounded. Kekoa is one of our best research partners and has been amazing in our education programs, where he is now a star, teaching children about marine conservation."</p>
<p>Much of the research Williams is able to do with monk seals at the lab, such as determining their aerobic dive limits, is directly relevant to conservation efforts. Interactions between people and monk seals along the Hawaiian coastline have caused some seals to venture further offshore into deeper waters. Research in the Williams lab is revealing details about the unique biology of monk seals that can inform the planning of marine protected areas to provide the best chances for the survival of the species.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Second chance</strong></p>
<p>The backstories of Kekoa and Selka are not unusual among the animals in the research programs at Long Marine Lab. "A lot of animals have been given a second chance here," Reichmuth said.</p>
<p>For a threatened species like the southern sea otter, it's discouraging when a young reproductive female like Selka doesn't make it in the wild or an older female like Old Lady is injured. By working with scientists, however, these individuals can still contribute to the welfare of their species by increasing our knowledge and understanding of their biology, including their remarkable cognitive and sensory abilities.</p>
<p>Reichmuth's work with sea lions has demonstrated long-term memory and cognitive skills once thought limited to humans. She has also done extensive research on the hearing sensitivity of seals and sea lions, information that is important for understanding the effects of manmade noise in the marine environment. Reichmuth is currently studying the sensory biology and physiology of Arctic ice seals, which are vulnerable to disturbance from increasing oil and gas exploration and other human activities in the Arctic.</p>
<p>Scientifically, the marine mammal researchers at Long Marine Lab have been enormously productive since the lab's opening in 1978. There's not always a direct line from these research programs to conservation outcomes, but so little is known about the biology of these species that just getting basic physiological measurements can be helpful in understanding the challenges they face in the wild.</p>
<p>"I think it would be unethical <em>not</em> to use the opportunities we have to learn as much as we can in ways that are positive for the animals," Reichmuth said. "It takes a lot of training and close cooperation with these animals to reveal the hidden aspects of their biology and their sensory and cognitive abilities, and I don't think there's any other place in the world where we could do this kind of work."</p>
<p>Research with the long-term residents at Long Marine Lab is based on a cooperative model that depends on a trusting relationship between the animals and the people working with them. In other words, the animals don't have to do anything they don't want to do.</p>
<p>"It's empowering for the animals, because they learn how to make things happen in their environment," Reichmuth said. "We're nurturing their curiosity and enthusiasm, so it's very engaging, and that's why they seem so eager to participate in these studies."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Unique programs</strong></p>
<p>With all of the animals now in temporary quarters during work on the marine mammal pools, the pace of research activities has slowed at Long Marine Lab. Meanwhile, Reichmuth and Williams are worried about maintaining the funding needed to continue their unique research programs. It's expensive to keep the animals healthy and well fed, and tight budgets at federal research agencies mean grant funding is getting much harder to come by.</p>
<p>"There is so much to be learned by allowing scientists and animals to work together, but everything is constrained by funding and opportunities," Reichmuth said.</p>
<p>"Imagine how the nature of conservation would change if we could ask the animals what they need to survive in the wild," Williams said. "That is what we are doing in our lab."</p>

Those two words represent an effort at UC Santa Cruz to improve graduation rates and decrease the time to earn degrees, regardless of high school, family income, race, or ethnicity.</p>
<p>First, &#8220;<a href="http://cpevc.ucsc.edu/envision-ucsc/goals/student-success/statement.html">Five for 2015</a>&#8221; goals were set in 2011, which led to the establishment of a <a href="https://studentsuccess.ucsc.edu/sssc">Student Success Steering Committee</a> and later the <a href="https://studentsuccess.ucsc.edu/">Division of Student Success</a>, the draft of a strategic plan to increase graduation rates by 10 percent, and the Student Success Evaluation &amp; Research Center (<a href="https://studentsuccess.ucsc.edu/sserc">SSERC</a>).</p>
<p>Then came recognition from the <a href="http://koret.org/">Koret Foundation</a>, a San Francisco-based organization that supports civic, cultural, and educational organizations that promote a vibrant and distinctive Bay Area. The foundation has selected UC Santa Cruz as one of 12 Koret University Partners and provided a $1 million grant for the new Koret Undergraduate Research Scholarships.</p>
<p><a href="https://ugr.ue.ucsc.edu/koretscholars">Applications</a> for the $1,500 undergraduate research scholarships are now open until Nov. 30. Fifty scholarships will be awarded to students in any discipline, and the grant will also provide limited funds for supplies, travel expenses, and stipends to faculty members and graduate students, who will mentor each project.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our goal is to make sure that these research opportunities are available to all students, whatever their background,&#8221; says Jaye Padgett, interim vice provost for Student Success. &#8220;When students are engaged in collaborative research, they are more likely to do well academically and graduate from college.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Koret Initiative proposal was authored by Padgett, along with Samara Foster, managing director of the SSERC; Nathaniel Deutsch, director of Jewish Studies and director of the Institute for Humanities Research; Richard Hughey, vice provost and dean of Undergraduate Education; and Tyrus Miller, vice provost and dean of Graduate Studies.</p>
<p>The initiative will also accomplish the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double the size of the <a href="http://honors.ucsc.edu/honors-programs/ucsc-scholars-program.html">College Scholars Program</a> to 400 students at 10 colleges, reaching 10 percent of the freshman-sophomore population, in an effort to prepare motivated students for research.</li>
<li>Showcase the research during <a href="http://honors.ucsc.edu/saw/">Student Achievement Week</a> each spring with the Koret Research Slam.</li>
<li>Carry out research within the SSERC to evaluate the effect of the student success programs on student retention rates. The grant will fund one graduate student researcher and two undergraduate research assistants under the leadership of SSERC Faculty Director Rebecca London and Managing Director Samara Foster.</li>
</ul>

That&#8217;s why he plans to go to a barbecue at Cabrillo College that will unite UC Santa Cruz and community college student veterans.</p>
<p>Kempis is a lead peer mentor for STARS, the popular acronym for Services for Transfer and Re-Entry Students, which provides support for students transferring to UC Santa Cruz after time at another college, or returning to or beginning their undergraduate education after years in the working world.</p>
<p>STARS goes out of its way to welcome students who are military veterans, offering drop-in appointments that help veterans make their way at UC Santa Cruz and find the services they need, as well as organizing get-togethers.</p>
<p>Peer mentors help veterans answer questions regarding their benefits such as the GI Bill. They also answer questions regarding class registration and campus life.</p>
<p>For Kempis, 26, his mentor work is a way to give back to others in the midst of transitioning to civilian life. He did his service in San Diego at Naval Base Point Loma. He mostly did administrative and security work on the <em>U.S.S. Asheville,</em> a submarine that has been nicknamed &#8220;The Ghost of the Coast.&#8221;</p>
<p>After completing his active duty, and working for a while at the Navy Operational Support Center in Alameda, he enrolled at UC Santa Cruz because of the campus&#8217;s beauty &#8220;and also because I&#8217;d heard the computer science program was pretty danged good.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it wasn&#8217;t always easy to adjust to college life. &#8220;It was a little bit daunting, coming off active duty and work, and the age and mentality difference,&#8221; he said. Veteran&#8217;s support at STARS helped him get housing and work out a few kinks in his first year.</p>
<p>Though he found it a challenge to ease into the fabric of UC Santa Cruz, his conversations with students about his military service were upbeat, he said.&#160; &#8220;A lot of students are genuinely surprised that we have a small population of reservists at UC Santa Cruz,&#8221; said Kempis, who is now in the Navy Reserve. &#160;&#8220;But they are surprised in a positive way. I&#8217;ve never run into any backlash. People understand where we come from.</p>
<p>&#8220;From my perspective, we (veterans) add a lot to the campus,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;We bring a lot, not just because of our experience but because of our more firm resolve, and a bit of that leadership component. A lot of students haven&#8217;t necessarily learned that yet. When you&#8217;ve made it this far and are going to school, you&#8217;re a bit more of a hard charger&#8221; when it comes to studies and deadlines.</p>
<p>Veteran students also add diversity to campus, said Brian Ragunan, coordinator for Veterans Education Team Support (VETS), the veteran outreach service at STARS. Ragunan served in the Marines in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>&#160;&#8220;I really enjoy watching veterans do well and supersede the stereotypes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They bring so much. Some of them have been managers and leaders and traveled all over the world. They are diverse racially, ethnically, and in terms of sexual preference and political views.&#160; We have veteran students who have served in Afghanistan, in Iraq, in Vietnam."</p>
<p>For Ragunan, Veterans Day is a reminder of the strength and resiliency of the veteran community.&#160;</p>
<p>"It is a day to be thankful of all of the good things the country and my military career gave me as well as to be grateful to be alive and appreciative of that simple fact," he said.</p>
<p>With help from people like Ragunan and Kempis, the campus has become an essential stepping stone in the veterans&#8217; lives as they transition from military service into civilian life. Veteran students receive priority housing and class enrollment at UC Santa Cruz. They can also take advantage of the resources at VETS, a home base for vets that includes drop-ins, peer mentoring, academic advising, and a newsletter..</p>
<p>Veterans also benefit from the generosity of former UC Santa Cruz staff members who want to help them thrive. A few years ago, the 200-member Retirees Association, made up mostly of retired staffers, created the UCSC Retirees Association Bruce Lane Memorial Scholarship.</p>
<p>The scholarship commemorates and honors Bruce Lane, a staff member from 1964 to 1991. He was hired as a project architect and was involved with the planning and construction of many key buildings on campus.</p>
<p>Lane was an officer in the Army Reserves for 35 years, and strongly endorsed supporting current UC Santa Cruz student veterans. He died in 2008.</p>

A female student reported that while she was walking on the foot path northwest from the Quarry Plaza, she was followed by three unknown male subjects who began calling out to her in an offensive manner.</p>
<p>As the student continued walking past the amphitheater toward Colleges Nine and Ten, one of the males stuck her on the head using a rock. She was able to flee the area and get help. She was treated by the Santa Cruz Fire Department for minor injuries.</p>
<p>The UC Santa Cruz Police Department is also investigating this as a possible hate crime because the assault may have been committed because of the actual or perceived protected characteristics of the student.</p>
<p>Suspect No. 1 was described as a male in his early 20s, unshaven, wearing unknown colored sweatpants, and a dark baseball cap.</p>
<p>Suspect No. 2 was described as a male in his early 20s, wearing a light colored sweatshirt.</p>
<p>Suspect No. 3 was described as a male in his early 20s.</p>
<p>Anyone with information regarding this crime is encouraged to call the UC Santa Cruz Police Department at 831&#8211;459&#8211;2231, ext. 1.</p>
<p>Report all crimes and suspicious activity or persons by dialing 911 or 831&#8211;459&#8211;2231, ext. 1. Reports may also be made by using one of the many &#8220;blue light,&#8221; emergency or elevator phones located throughout the campus, or in person at the UC Santa Cruz Police Department.</p>

(Photo by Carolyn Lagattuta.)</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text>Artie Konrad has always wanted to make a positive contribution to the world. After college, he taught stress reduction and meditation to K-12 students in the Mission District of San Francisco. He founded a tutoring company to build students' confidence by supporting them academically. And as a Ph.D. student in psychology at UC Santa Cruz, he developed phone apps that prompt users to reflect on past experiences, because reminiscing reconnects people with positive emotions. <br/>
 <br/>
 "I've always been this way," said Konrad. "It's just how I'm built. I have to be doing something that's having an impact on social good and well-being." &#160;<br/>
 <br/>
 Now Konrad has found his dream job at Facebook, where he joined the "social good" team just after earning his doctorate last winter. This is the group that developed Safety Check so Facebook users can notify loved ones in the event of an emergency. They also created the "Donate" button to facilitate charitable giving. With 1.5 billion users worldwide, Facebook is a powerful force: The Facebook community donated more to survivors of the earthquake in Nepal than did the U.S. government. <br/>
 <br/>
 Today, Konrad is a user experience researcher on Facebook's On This Day project&#8212;the feature that populates users' feeds with photos, posts, and status updates from the past. &#160;<br/>
 <br/>
 "It's a positive experience to connect with the past, and people are reporting to us how much they enjoy seeing their memories," said Konrad. <br/>
 <br/>
 Konrad credits his advisor, Psychology Professor Steve Whittaker, with inspiring him. <br/>
 <br/>
 "When I started at UCSC, I saw technology as the opposite of well-being, but as I got into it, I saw the advantages and the potential and focused my research on reminiscence and technology," he said. "Steve is a rock star of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). I got more than I ever expected to get out of my education, largely because of Steve. He's so accomplished in the field." <br/>
 <br/>
 Whittaker says Silicon Valley companies like Facebook and Google are hiring UCSC psychology graduates like Konrad because of what they understand about human motivation and human behavior.<br/>
 <br/>
 Konrad started working with the On This Day team as an intern and had a job offer before he graduated. "It's amazing how perfect the fit is," he marveled. "I&#8217;ve spent years researching technologies just like On This Day, so to come in with that background helped me connect new dots for the team. They have been welcoming, and I feel like I&#8217;ve found a home.&#8221; &#160;<br/>
 <br/>
 The use of technology to support reminiscence, which Konrad calls Technology-Mediated Reflection (or TMR), is in its infancy compared to technologies that support behavior change. Just think about the ubiquitous Fitbit and the plethora of apps to help us manage our time better, control our spending, and organize our lives.<br/>
 <br/>
 For someone like Konrad, the opportunity to research the efficacy of TMR on a scale as vast as Facebook is phenomenal. "The studies I did as a grad student involved maybe 400 people whose well-being was improved," he said. "At Facebook, we have the ability to reach a much higher number of people." <br/>
 <br/>
 Konrad is quick to note that the company's goal isn't to measure or manipulate well-being, or even to increase it. It's simply to connect users with memories in hopes of giving them a positive experience. "We have the tool that offers access, and we hope there's some delight as we connect you to your past," he said.<br/>
 <br/>
 Introduced just over a year ago, On This Day is a new but growing product. "The saying at Facebook is 'The journey is only 1 percent finished'," noted Konrad. "On This Day has so much potential and I&#8217;m excited about what&#8217;s in store." Indeed, driven by algorithms, the feature early on connected some users with memories they would just as soon forget; Facebook has since improved its algorithms and added controls so users can filter out what they don't want to see. <br/>
 <br/>
 As a front-line researcher, Konrad said product managers and stakeholders come to him with questions. His job is to figure out how to get answers and then communicate findings to a diverse group with a wide range of professional expertise. He relies on interviews and surveys to gather information about the user experience&#8212;how people navigate and feel about the site. <br/>
 <br/>
 "Many researchers specialize in either quantitative or qualitative methods," said Konrad. "I'm a mixed-methods researcher. I have skills across the spectrum, and I employ them all. I like to ask big foundational questions, as well as targeted questions that have more immediate impact. I love doing multi-stage research and in-depth interviews for the opportunity to dive deep."<br/>
 <br/>
 Konrad, a San Francisco native who studied cognitive science at UC Berkeley as an undergraduate, completed his graduate work in less than five years. Interest in technology among psychology students increased notably even during that short span, he said, and faculty are increasingly supportive of students like him who want to work in industry. <br/>
 <br/>
 "Well-being is the thread that runs through my research. I have other interests&#8212;I want to understand myself&#8212;but doing this research, we're going to learn something about <em>us</em>," said Konrad. "Facebook has the potential to answer some really important questions. The work is very gratifying. We're having an impact and having a positive effect on people."</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="64e5211f8072701752a34ca3307ebe88"><name>prop-64</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Marijuana prohibited on UC property, despite passage of Prop. 64</title><summary>Recreational marijuana is now legal in California, but it's still prohibited at the University of California and at UC Santa Cruz.</summary><start-date>1479110400000</start-date><display-name>Marijuana prohibited on UC property, despite passage of Prop. 64</display-name><path>/2016/11/prop-64</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/11/prop-64</link><created-by>atruscot</created-by><created-on>1479161486040</created-on><last-modified-by>atruscot</last-modified-by><last-modified>1479161486040</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Graduate Students</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Recreational marijuana is now legal in California, but it's still prohibited at the University of California and at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>UC prohibits the use, possession and sale of marijuana-in any form-on all university property, including university-owned and leased buildings, housing and parking lots. Marijuana is also not permitted at university events or while conducting university business.</p>
<p>California voters on Nov. 8 passed Proposition 64, legalizing the use of recreational marijuana among people over the age of 21. Prop. 64 does not change UC policy.</p>
<p>Using and possessing marijuana is still illegal under federal law. The federal Drug Free Schools and Communities Act, and the Drug Free Workplace Act require that UC, which receives federal funding, have policies that prohibit marijuana use, possession, and distribution on campus and in the workplace.</p>
<p>UC students and employees who violate the university's policy may face discipline, with a maximum penalty of dismissal.</p>
<p>In addition, UC's Smoke and Tobacco Free Policy prohibits the use and sale of cigarettes, e-cigarettes and other tobacco products on all campuses and medical centers.</p>

<p>In addition, two UC Santa Cruz professors are among the 10 new fellows elected to the California Academy of Sciences in 2016. They are Karen Holl, professor of environmental studies, and Erika Zavaleta, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology.</p>
<p>Academy fellows are distinguished scientists who have made notable contributions to one or more of the natural sciences. They are nominated by their colleagues and appointed by the board of trustees to govern the academy. Induction of new fellows and presentation of the Fellows Medal take place at the academy's meeting on November 15. Faber, who is currently out of the country, will give an acceptance speech by pre-recorded video.</p>
<p>Faber is known for her pioneering research on the formation and evolution of galaxies, distant galaxy clusters, and the large-scale structure of the universe. She helped create the CANDELS project, the largest survey of the universe undertaken by the Hubble Space Telescope. This incredibly rich database provides unique material for studying every aspect of galaxy evolution, from mass assembly to star-formation. Faber's multifaceted projects&#8212;including the DEEP2 survey of 50,000 distant galaxies&#8212;often include the participation of her former students. A member of the National Academy of Sciences, American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and American Philosophical Society, Faber has received many awards and honors in recognition of her accomplishments, including the National Medal of Science. She joined the UCSC faculty in 1972.</p>
<p>Holl is the faculty director of the Kenneth S. Norris Center for Natural History at UC Santa Cruz. Her research focuses on understanding how local and landscape-scale processes impact ecosystem recovery from human disturbance, and how this information can help restore damaged ecosystems. She conducts research in Latin American rainforests and in chaparral, grassland, and riparian systems in California. Selected as an Aldo Leopold Leadership Fellow in 2008, Holl is a dedicated science communicator and teacher committed to lending her expertise to the next generation of scientists. She received her Ph.D. from Virginia Tech and completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Stanford University before joining the UCSC faculty in 1995.</p>
<p>Zavaleta is the founder and faculty leader for the Doris Duke Conservation Scholars Program at UC Santa Cruz. Her research group studies the drivers and consequences of changing biological diversity and climate, and the role of ecology in guiding effective conservation and climate change adaptation practice. <em>Ecosystems of California</em> (UC Press, 2016), a new comprehensive reference of California's ecological abundance coedited by Zavaleta, is nominated for a 2017 American Publishers PROSE Award. She received her undergraduate and graduate degrees at Stanford University.</p>
<p>The California Academy of Sciences, based in San Francisco&#8217;s Golden Gate Park, is a renowned scientific and educational institution dedicated to exploring, explaining, and sustaining life on Earth.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="657df6df8072701752a34ca38738b689"><name>nondiscrimination-policy</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Formal review, employee comment re: Nondiscrimination and Affirmative Action Policy </title><summary>The University of California is proposing revisions to the systemwide Nondiscrimination and Affirmative Action Policy Regarding Academic and Staff Employment.

 <br/>
 In addition to the new legal requirements, the policy has been revised to include language describing free speech and academic freedom protections. This language has already been approved for the Presidential Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment.&#160; The proposed name of this revised policy is, Nondiscrimination, Harassment, and Affirmative Action in the Workplace.<br/>
 <br/>
 Coincident with the proposed revisions to this systemwide policy, there is one proposed revision to systemwide academic personnel policy, The Faculty Code of Conduct, APM 015.&#160; This proposed revision is posted separately on the Academic Personnel Office website at: <a href="http://apo.ucsc.edu/policy/policy-under-review.html">http://apo.ucsc.edu/policy/policy-under-review.html</a>.&#160; Faculty who wish to provide feedback on this proposed revision should submit their comments to Susan Fellows by December 9, 2016 at <a href="mailto:sfellows@ucsc.edu">sfellows@ucsc.edu</a>.<br/>

<p>Then, with just 54 hours to merge into teams, give life to their budding concepts, develop strategies, and prepare presentations to the community, things really start happening.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone who&#8217;s passionate about sustainability or having a social impact is invited,&#8221; said Jacqueline &#8220;Jax&#8221; Puliatti, a fourth year environmental studies major and a graphic artist at the <a href="http://sustainability.ucsc.edu">UCSC Sustainability Office</a>, which is cosponsoring the event along with local and regional companies, organizations, and economic development agencies.</p>
<p>The first Startup Weekend Santa Cruz for Sustainable Solutions &amp; Social Impact, Nov. 18&#8211;20, is just one of more than 200 events happening in November as part of Global Startup Weekend. Independent events, held internationally, are expected to draw together more than 15,000 entrepreneurs and mentors to create commercial ventures.</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole point of this event is to create opportunities for people to mingle and talk about these issues and cross-pollinate,&#8221; Puliatti said. &#8220;Attendees will see the different approaches people have to these issues and get to connect with others who want to do good in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>The event, which starts with 60-second pitches, ends Sunday with five-minute presentations to local judges. The public is invited to attend Sunday for the final presentations at 5 p.m. at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art &amp; History.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a lot of fun,&#8221; said event organizer Tom Beckett (Kresge 2013), who works for a Santa Cruz biotech startup and as a Kickstarter funding consultant. Beckett wanted to bring the event to town after attending a startup weekend in Southern California last year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The best comparison is watching a live episode of &#8216;Shark Tank&#8217; minus the attitudes and drama,&#8221; Beckett said. &#8220;It&#8217;s cool to see what people put together from a 60-second pitch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Organizers expect to attract entrepreneurs, designers, and marketers as well as social activists and people from local nonprofit organizations who have real-world experience to share.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to have any background in technology or business to come to Startup Weekend Santa Cruz,&#8221; said Melissa Ott, an office&#160;manager and events coordinator in the Office of Sustainability. Ott has been working with entrepreneurs in the community and partners on campus to bring together technologists and activists, project managers and nonprofit leaders for a weekend to create change.</p>
<p>Pitch ideas could focus on solutions for food, water, housing, health, energy, transportation, waste and more. But, participants don&#8217;t have to bring an idea to attend. At the heart of the immersive weekend is collaboration, the idea that everyone has something to offer in the quest to solve the world&#8217;s social and environmental problems. The best startups spring from people of different skills and experiences.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we turn to our own community, I think we can see the impact of challenges we&#8217;re facing locally and globally,&#8221; Ott said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a great opportunity to bring ideas that are flourishing and see what could be created.</p>
<p>Another benefit is getting to know people in the community, Beckett said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Participants get exposed to resources that are available locally and get to work with people who are interested in the things they&#8217;re interested in. It&#8217;s a pretty wide mix of people."</p>
<p>Volunteer organizers, mentors and local sponsors have helped keep ticket prices down, feed participants and provide student scholarships. In addition to the Sustainability Office, sponsors include The Everett Program, Looker, Santa Cruz Works, Santa Cruz economic Development, Small Business Development Center, Santa Cruz Tech Beat, Santa Cruz 350 and Startup Catalyst.</p>

Either a nitrogen layer more than 40 km thick (panel b) or an uplifted ocean (panel c) could result in a present-day positive gravity anomaly at Sputnik Planitia; otherwise, the gravity anomaly will be strongly negative (panel a). (Image from Nimmo et al., <em>Nature</em>, 2016)</p></image-caption></secondary-images><article-subhead>Findings suggest other large objects in the Kuiper belt may also have liquid oceans beneath frozen shells</article-subhead><article-text><p>A liquid ocean lying deep beneath Pluto's frozen surface is the best explanation for features revealed by NASA's New Horizons spacecraft, according to a new analysis. The idea that Pluto has a subsurface ocean is not new, but the study provides the most detailed investigation yet of its likely role in the evolution of key features such as the vast, low-lying plain known as Sputnik Planitia (formerly Sputnik Planum).</p>
<p>Sputnik Planitia, which forms one side of the famous heart-shaped feature seen in the first New Horizons images, is suspiciously well aligned with Pluto's tidal axis. The likelihood that this is just a coincidence is only 5 percent, so the alignment suggests that extra mass in that location interacted with tidal forces between Pluto and its moon Charon to reorient Pluto, putting Sputnik Planitia directly opposite the side facing Charon. But a deep basin seems unlikely to provide the extra mass needed to cause that kind of reorientation.</p>
<p>"It's a big, elliptical hole in the ground, so the extra weight must be hiding somewhere beneath the surface. And an ocean is a natural way to get that," said Francis Nimmo, professor of Earth and planetary sciences at UC Santa Cruz and first author of a paper on the new findings <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature20148.html">published November 16 in <em>Nature</em></a>. Another paper in the same issue, led by James Keane at the University of Arizona, also argues for reorientation and points to fractures on Pluto as evidence that this happened.</p>
<p><strong>Impact basin</strong></p>
<p>Like other large basins in the solar system, Sputnik Planitia was most likely created by the impact of a giant meteorite, which would have blasted away a huge amount of Pluto's icy crust. With a subsurface ocean, the response to this would be an upwelling of water pushing up against the thinned and weakened crust of ice. At equilibrium, because water is denser than ice, that would still leave a fairly deep basin with a thin crust of ice over the upwelled mass of water.</p>
<p>"At that point, there is no extra mass at Sputnik Planitia," Nimmo explained. "What happens then is the ice shell gets cold and strong, and the basin fills with nitrogen ice. That nitrogen represents the excess mass."</p>
<p>Nimmo and his colleages also considered whether the extra mass could be provided by just a deep crater filled with nitrogen ice, with no upwelling of a subsurface ocean. But their calculations showed that this would require an implausibly deep layer of nitrogen, more than 25 miles (40 kilometers) thick. They found that a nitrogen layer about 4 miles (7 km) thick above a subsurface ocean provides enough mass to create a "positive gravity anomaly" consistent with the observations.</p>
<p>"We tried to think of other ways to get a positive gravity anomaly, and none of them look as likely as a subsurface ocean," Nimmo said.</p>
<p><strong>Moon anomalies</strong></p>
<p>Coauthor Douglas Hamilton of the University of Maryland came up with the reorientation hypothesis, and Nimmo developed the subsurface ocean scenario. The scenario is analogous to what occurred on the moon, where positive gravity anomalies have been accurately measured for several large impact basins. Instead of a subsurface ocean, however, the dense mantle material beneath the moon's crust pushed up against the thinned crust of the impact basins. Lava flows then flooded the basins, adding the extra mass. On icy Pluto, the basin filled with frozen nitrogen.</p>
<p>"There's plenty of nitrogen in Pluto's atmosphere, and either it preferentially freezes out in this low basin, or it freezes out in the high areas surrounding the basin and flows down as glaciers," Nimmo said. The images from New Horizons do show what appear to be nitrogen glaciers flowing out of mountainous terrain around Sputnik Planitia.</p>
<p>As for the subsurface ocean, Nimmo said he suspects it is mostly water with some kind of antifreeze in it, probably ammonia. The slow refreezing of the ocean would put stress on the icy shell, causing fractures consistent with features seen in the New Horizons images.</p>
<p>There are other large objects in the Kuiper belt that are similar to Pluto in size and density, and Nimmo said they probably also have subsurface oceans. "When we look at these other objects, they may be equally interesting, not just frozen snowballs," he said.</p>

Investigators believe that at least one of the suspects yelled homophobic slurs because of the actual or perceived sexual orientation of the victim.</p>
<p>In addition, we have received several tips and are seeking community assistance in identifying suspects who may be associated with this case.</p>
<ul>
<li>On Friday, November 11, at approximately 10 p.m., three subjects in a 2010 or newer white Ford Mustang yelled obscenities at a female student walking on Meyer Road. No further description of the males has been provided.</li>
<li>On Friday, November 11, shortly before the assault, surveillance video in the area captured three males walking north through the Quarry Plaza. It appears that one was wearing a hat. Due to the quality of the video, further description of the subjects is unavailable at this time.</li>
<li>On Saturday, November 12, at approximately 10 p.m., female students in the Porter Meadow were approached by three males. The students chose to leave the meadow and entered into the Porter B residence hall. Shortly thereafter, the three males were seen in the Porter B residence hall, and are believed to have written obscene words on the white board of one of the female students. No further description of the males has been provided.</li>
</ul>

The annual award is the division's highest honor for faculty achievement, recognizing combined excellence in research, teaching, and service.</p>
<p>Mascharak's research focuses on the structure and function of enzymes, green chemistry, and designing novel drugs for cancer and other diseases. The author of more than 200 peer-reviewed publications, he is also recognized as a gifted teacher and mentor.</p>
<p>"Professor Mascharak has an outstanding record in research, teaching and exceptional service to the campus and the broader scientific community. The Outstanding Faculty Award...is a richly deserved campus recognition for his exemplary record," wrote Paul Koch, dean of physical and biological sciences, in a letter announcing the award.</p>
<p>In recent years, Mascharak's lab has been studying and synthesizing photoactive compounds that release nitric oxide or carbon monoxide when exposed to light. Since nitric oxide and carbon monoxide are biological signaling molecules with antimicrobial and other properties, there is great potential to use compounds that release them in biomedical therapies.</p>
<p>Mascharak's work with nitric oxide complexes has shown promise for both cancer therapy and antimicrobial treatments. For example, in collaboration with chemistry professor Scott Oliver, Mascharak has developed a composite powder that can be applied directly to a wound or incorporated into a bandage to prevent infection by drug-resistant bacteria. Since he began this thread of work in 2002, Mascharak has published nearly 70 papers in top chemistry and medical journals, and several of the complexes he developed have been patented.</p>
<p>Despite teaching challenging courses, Mascharak regularly receives exceptional student evaluations. Over the course of his tenure at UC Santa Cruz, he has advised 24 Ph.D. students who have graduated, eight of whom are currently faculty members at other institutions. For his exceptional work mentoring minority students and encouraging them to succeed, he received the Excellence Through Diversity Award.</p>
<p>Mascharak is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the recipient of a Sloan Research Fellowship. In 2017, he will receive the Chemical Research Society of India Medal, a highly selective award given to scientists of Indian origin who have contributed extensively to the promotion of the field. This great honor follows another unique achievement in 2014, when Mascharak was awarded the Mahatma Gandhi Pravasi Samman Gold Medal in a ceremony at the House of Lords in London. This award recognizes outstanding service and achievements by Indians in the international arena.</p>
<p>Mascharak earned his B.S. and M.S. degrees at the University of Burdwan, India, and his Ph.D. at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1984.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2012/05/nitric-oxide.html</url><title>Light-induced

href="http://rjoyoakland.org"><em><strong>Restorative Justice for Oakland Youth</strong></em></a>--will deliver the 2016 Peggy Downes Baskin Ethics Lecture on Thursday, December 1, at the Music Center Recital Hall on the UC Santa Cruz campus.<br/>
<br/>
 Davis will talk about the origins and practice of restorative justice, as well as its intersections with feminist and relational theory, abolitionism, Black Lives Matter, and movements to end sexual violence.</p>
<p>Restorative justice is a model of criminal justice that focuses on the rehabilitation of offenders through reconciliation with victims and the community at large.<br/>
<br/>
 The murder of two close childhood friends in the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, stirred Davis to a lifetime of social activism. Since then, she has been active in the civil rights, Black liberation, women&#8217;s, prisoner&#8217;s, peace, anti-racial violence, and anti-apartheid movements.<br/>
<br/>
 She also spent nearly three decades as a civil rights trial lawyer after earning a law degree from UC Berkeley in 1979.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;I&#8217;ve known her since the late 60s,&#8221; noted UC Santa Cruz professor of feminist studies Bettina Aptheker. &#8220;She and I worked very closely together on the movement to free Angela Davis&#8212;her sister. She was featured in the film <em>Free Angela and All Political Prisoners</em>, the 2012 documentary by Shola Lynch.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 Aptheker added that she had originally planned to bring Davis to campus to speak to her <em>Feminism &amp; Social Justice</em> class. But she ended up instead recommending her for the Ethics Lecture.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;In light of last week&#8217;s election, this talk cannot be more urgent,&#8221; said Aptheker. &#8220;Mass incarceration has been one of the big issues of our time, and the black community has been particularly impacted by it&#8212;as well as other communities of color. And this movement of restorative justice is part of an effort to create alternatives to prison.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;It&#8217;s a practical way of showing people that prison abolition is a practical goal,&#8221; Aptheker added. &#8220;That&#8217;s what restorative justice is--and does--in the community.&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 Davis has received numerous honors, including the Ubuntu Service to Humanity award; the Maloney award recognizing exceptional contributions in youth-based restorative justice, and World Trust&#8217;s Healing Justice award. She was also featured last year in a <em>Los Angeles Times</em> article titled &#8220;The New Civil Right Leaders: Emerging Voices in the 21st&#160; Century.&#8221;&#160;&#160; &#160;<br/>
<br/>
 As Davis noted in a guest commentary for the <em>Oakland Tribune</em>:<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;Oakland is emerging as a national model in using cultural restorative justice approaches to interrupt the school-to-prison pipeline, break cycles of racialized mass incarceration, and bring community healing.<br/>
<br/>
 &#8220;Our successes are receiving national media attention from <em>The New York Times, NPR, NBC, PRI</em>, Smithsonian Institution&#8217;s <em>Story Corps</em> and others. The feds have taken notice. Civil Rights Assistant Secretary Russlyn Ali noted what is happening in Oakland is &#8216;a model process we hope to see repeated again and again across the country.&#8217;&#8221;<br/>
<br/>
 The Ethics Lecture is made possible by the Peggy Downes Baskin Humanities Endowment for Interdisciplinary Ethics, which enables the Humanities Division to promote a dialogue about ethics and ethics related challenges in an interdisciplinary setting. The endowment was established in honor of Peggy Downes Baskin&#8217;s longtime interest in ethical issues across the academic spectrum.</p>

<p>Roughly 200 people stood in Quarry Plaza to listen to campus leaders talk about the thoughts and feelings expressed by many students in the last week.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our campus is committed to all of our students, and our entire community, regardless of anyone&#8217;s race, ethnicity, disability status, gender, sexuality, gender identity, religion, immigration status, or whatever challenging life experiences they&#8217;ve faced,&#8221; interim Vice Provost for Student Success Jaye Padgett said.</p>
<p>Padgett noted that the division includes resource centers, Student Organization Advising and Resources (SOAR), Learning Support Services, and more.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re the Division of Student Success, so our job is to support the academic success of our students,&#8221; Padgett said. &#8220;But we know that academic success is not just about study skills. Much of our Division&#8217;s work was founded in historical struggles to give equal access to education and life opportunities to all people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other speakers included Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway, interim Dean of Students Lucy Rojas, Academic Senate Chair Olof Einarsdottir, and Kresge College Provost Ben Leeds Carson.</p>
<p>After the brief speeches, members of the campus community wrote messages on canvas as part of an art project.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="7a15af6b8072701752a34ca3d8e59706"><name>pre-vet-club</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Caring for our animal friends</title><summary>The student-run Pre-Veterinary Club is designed to support and energize those who want a career working with animals.</summary><keywords>Pre-Veterinary Club</keywords><start-date>1479456000000</start-date><display-name>Caring for our animal friends</display-name><path>/2016/11/pre-vet-club</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/11/pre-vet-club</link><created-by>gwenj</created-by><created-on>1479516989997</created-on><last-modified-by>gwenj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1479517188977</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Alumni</value><value>Staff</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>Prospective Students</value><value>Donors</value><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>Parents and Family</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Experiential Learning</value><value>Social Consciousness</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Banana Slug Life</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Peggy Townsend</name><title></title><phone/><email>gwenj@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/11/images/karolina-pre-vet.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/11/images/karolina-pre-vet.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>karolina-pre-vet.jpg</name><display-name>karolina-pre-vet.jpg</display-name><file-size>34759</file-size><width>400</width><height>600</height></image><image-alt>Karolina Wirga, a Cowell neuroscience major, is president of UC Santa Cruz’s student-run P</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/11/images/karolina-pre-vet-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/11/images/karolina-pre-vet-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>karolina-pre-vet-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>karolina-pre-vet-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>2538</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Karolina Wirga, a Cowell neuroscience major, is president of UC Santa Cruz’s student-run P</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>Karolina Wirga, a Cowell neuroscience major, is president of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s student-run Pre-Veterinary Club.

<p>For Fou Fou, a stray currently residing at the Santa Cruz County Animal Shelter, these minutes with Wirga, a neuroscience major at UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s Cowell College, are about getting some TLC and also being socialized so he&#8217;ll have a better chance of finding a new home.</p>
<p>For Wirga, these moments are about her passion for animals and her goal of becoming a veterinarian in communities where veterinary services are an unaffordable luxury. It&#8217;s also part of the volunteer work she does in her role as president of UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s student-run Pre-Veterinary Club.</p>
<p>With 29 members at its first meeting of the year and an active calendar of events that includes talks by veterinarians and animal experts, the campus&#8217;s Pre-Veterinary Club is designed to support and energize those who want a career working with animals.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Pre-Vet Club is the reason I stuck with it (the goal of becoming a veterinarian),&#8221; says Katie Githens, 21, vice president of the club and a double major in marine biology and molecular, cell and developmental biology at Stevenson College. &#8220;When I first came here, I felt a little alone but then I saw the Pre-Vet Club table at the OPERS Festival and that was it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both Githens and Wirga came to UC Santa Cruz with the idea of becoming veterinarians, even though the campus doesn&#8217;t offer a formal pre-veterinary medicine major. Dogs and cats were part of each of their lives growing up, they say, and both talk about the close connection they feel with animals.</p>
<p>Githens, who plans to graduate in spring 2017, is considering specializing in exotic and large-animal medicine with the idea of working in a zoo.</p>
<p>Wirga, who also is a senior at UC Santa Cruz, was influenced by trips to Guatemala and Nicaragua where she worked alongside veterinarians to provide health care and spay-and-neuter services to animals whose owners could not afford the cost of veterinary care, she says.</p>
<p>Sitting outside McHenry Library on a warm fall day, she describes a fluffy white dog named Boji who came into a clinic in Guatemala with large tumors on his neck and genitals. The tumors were bleeding and the dog was in such bad shape, veterinarians weren&#8217;t able to operate, she says.</p>
<p>&#8220;I helped monitor and take care of the dog as it got chemotherapy and after the first treatment the tumors had reduced 70 percent in size,&#8221; Wirga says. &#8220;We were able to give him a good life and help him be in less pain. That was really good.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s why, she says, she wants to work among animals in underprivileged communities.</p>
<p>While both Wirga and Githens still face four years of veterinary school, they are immersed in science classes at UC Santa Cruz and in the activities of the Pre-Veterinary Club, which has been in existence for about five years.</p>
<p>Meetings include discussions about class requirements and applications for veterinary school, types of veterinary specialties available, and visits by professionals who discuss their work. Volunteer work ranges from animal interaction at the county&#8217;s two shelters to working at the Monterey Bay Horsemanship and Therapeutic Center, where people with disabilities come for horseback riding experiences.</p>
<p>Sitting with Fou Fou in her lap, Wirga says her volunteer work &#8220;gives me my animal fix&#8221; and also provides her with the chance to improve her skills communicating with and understanding animals. It&#8217;s also a reminder of the beauty with which animals approach life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Animals are really present in the moment,&#8221; she says. &#8220;&#8230;They&#8217;re pretty content where they&#8217;re at.&#8221;</p>
<p>She gives Fou Fou a belly rub. &#8220;I think animals have a healing energy to them.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="82e8a8ce8072701752a34ca330e9cb43"><name>astronomy-faculty</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>New faculty rejuvenate Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics</title><summary>New astronomy faculty bring with them a wide range of expertise in some of the most exciting areas of astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology.</summary><keywords>Ruth Murray-Clay, Ryan Foley, Alexie Leauthaud, Ken Bundy, Brant Robertson, Andrew Skemer, Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, Sandra Faber</keywords><start-date>1480348800000</start-date><display-name>New faculty rejuvenate Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics</display-name><path>/2016/11/astronomy-faculty</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/11/astronomy-faculty</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1479665034065</created-on><last-modified-by>lasnier</last-modified-by><last-modified>1480900155164</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name><value>Astronomy and Astrophysics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>Academics</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Faculty</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Astro and Planets</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/11/images/faculty-grid-425.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/11/images/faculty-grid-425.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>faculty-grid-425.jpg</name><display-name>faculty-grid-425.jpg</display-name><file-size>111774</file-size><width>425</width><height>384</height></image><image-alt>photos of new faculty members</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/11/images/faculty-grid-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/11/images/faculty-grid-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>faculty-grid-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>faculty-grid-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>26826</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>photos of new faculty</image-thumb-alt><image-caption><p>New faculty in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics.

<p>UC Santa Cruz has long been recognized as one of the world's leading centers for both observational and theoretical research in astronomy and astrophysics. Some of the department's biggest stars are reaching retirement age, however, including two members of the National Academy of Sciences, professors emeriti Sandra Faber and Stan Woosley. Department chair Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz said the new faculty are crucial to maintaining the department's tradition of excellence.</p>
<p>"These are all up and coming young faculty who are already having tremendous impact in their fields," Ramirez-Ruiz said.</p>
<p>One result has been a big shift in the age distribution of the department, which Faber, for one, said she welcomes. "Youth matters, and somehow the atmosphere in the department really is different--you can feel the optimism and the energy, and it makes the department a fun place to be," she said.</p>
<p><strong>Grad students</strong></p>
<p>The new faculty are joined this year by one of the largest and most diverse classes of new graduate students in the department's history. Ramirez-Ruiz said he sees the diversity of the department as integral to the science, noting that many studies have shown how groups of diverse individuals with differing viewpoints outperform homogenous groups to find solutions that are more innovative, creative, and responsive to complex problems.</p>
<p>"Diversity, equity, and inclusion are the science leadership issues of our time, and I see enormous potential and opportunity in the growing diversity of our nation and of the field of science," he said. "As we welcome more diverse individuals into astronomy, we increase the potential to do great science, with the best minds and most diverse perspectives our field has ever seen."</p>
<p>The new faculty include theorists, observers, and instrument designers, with interests ranging from exoplanets and planetary systems to exploding stars and dark energy. The 2016 arrivals include professor <strong>Ruth Murray-Clay</strong>, assistant professor <strong>Ryan Foley</strong>, assistant professor <strong>Alexie Leauthaud</strong>, and <strong>Kevin Bundy</strong>, an adjunct professor and associate researcher with <a href="http://ucolick.org/home/index.html">UC Observatories</a>. Associate professor <strong>Brant Robertson</strong> and assistant professor <strong>Andrew Skemer</strong> arrived in 2015.</p>
<p>Murray-Clay studies how planetary systems form and evolve. She is working to understand newly discovered planetary systems around other stars using a variety of theoretical techniques. She also leads a team in&#160;the <a href="http://www.ossos-survey.org">Outer Solar System Origins Survey</a>, studying objects in the outer reaches of our solar system for clues to its evolution. In 2015, Murray-Clay won the <a href="https://aas.org/grants-and-prizes/helen-b-warner-prize-astronomy">Helen B. Warner Prize for Astronomy</a>, which recognizes the exceptional contributions of astronomers under the age of 36.</p>
<p>While Murray-Clay takes a theoretical approach to studying planetary systems, Skemer focuses on the observational side, specializing in direct imaging of exoplanets. He is developing new astronomical instruments and observational techniques to improve the ability of astronomers to see and study very faint planets near their bright host stars. Skemer won a <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/02/sloan-fellows.html">Sloan Research Fellowship</a> in 2016.</p>
<p>Bundy is another expert in astronomical instruments and observational astronomy. He is leading work on a key instrument for the <a href="http://www.tmt.org/">Thirty Meter Telescope</a> (TMT) called the Wide Field Optical Spectrograph. Bundy's other main project is leading the <a href="http://www.sdss.org/surveys/manga/">Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA)</a> survey, one of three core projects for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV).</p>
<p>Bundy and Leauthaud (who are married) spent the past five years in Japan at the Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe at Tokyo University. Leauthaud is a cosmologist who studies questions related to dark matter, dark energy, and the relationship between dark matter and galaxies. She uses data from large galaxy surveys to measure the gravitational lensing effect (when a dense aggregation of mass bends the light from a more distant object), which can be used to understand the distribution of dark matter in the universe.</p>
<p>Foley, who was <a href="http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/10/foley-packard-fellow.html">awarded a prestigious Packard Fellowship for Science and Engineering</a> in October and also received a 2015 Sloan Research Fellowship, is an astrophysicist who studies exploding stars (supernovae) and other transient celestial phenomena, and uses supernova observations to study dark energy and cosmology. He is leading two surveys, the Foundation Supernova Survey and the Swope Supernova Survey, which will set the foundation for future cosmology projects such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and the Wide-Field Infrared Telescope (WFIRST).</p>
<p>Robertson is a theoretical astrophysicist who uses the world's most powerful supercomputers to simulate the physics of galaxy formation. He uses theory to develop science programs for the major new NASA observatories, WFIRST and the James Webb Space Telescope, and for the LSST, currently under construction in Chile. Robertson and Foley both lead WFIRST teams helping to plan projects and strategies for making the best use of the telescope.</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Next generation</strong></p>
<p>Ramirez-Ruiz said the campus's investment in astronomy faculty, including the next generation of instrument designers, is particularly significant after a period of budgetary uncertainty and changes in the way UC supports UC Observatories and the Lick Observatory astronomers based at UC Santa Cruz. "Thanks to the leadership and vision of our dean, Paul Koch, the campus has made a big investment in the excellence of the astronomy program by hiring all these great people to replace those who have left or retired," he said.</p>
<p>A $160,000 gift from James L. Gunderson and Valerie J. Boom has helped the recruitment effort by establishing the department's first endowed chair, the E. K. Gunderson Family Chair in Theoretical Astrophysics. The chair honors the work of Gunderson's father, a psychologist whose work on human adaptation to confined and extreme conditions was used by NASA in understanding the implications of space travel.</p>
<p>The strong reputation of UC Santa Cruz in astronomy and astrophysics not only attracts good faculty, it also helps the faculty recruit good graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. Ramirez-Ruiz noted that graduate students who earn Ph.D.s in astronomy and astrophysics from UC Santa Cruz routinely win prestigious postdoctoral fellowships. This year, those include Morgan MacLeod, now a NASA Einstein Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton; Caroline Morley, a NASA Sagan Fellow at Harvard University; Elizabeth Lovegrove, a Metropolis Fellow at Los Alamos National Laboratory; and Jennifer Burt, a Juan Carlos Torres Fellow in Astrophysics at the MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research.</p>
<p>"Our most recent graduating class was very successful in landing highly desirable, well recognized postdoctoral positions," Ramirez-Ruiz said. "I look forward to seeing what our newest class of amazing graduate students will do."</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2016/10/foley-packard-fellow.html</url><title>Astronomer

For most people, it's not a serious disease, but structural biologist Rebecca DuBois saw how devastating it can be when she worked at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.</p>
<p>"There were all these young cancer patients who were successfully fighting their cancer, but they were getting severe chronic astrovirus infections because the chemotherapy suppressed their immune systems, and there was no treatment for it," said DuBois, now an assistant professor of biomolecular engineering at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>By studying the astrovirus capsid, the protein shell of the viral particles, the DuBois lab is laying the foundation for new antiviral therapies and vaccines for human astroviruses. In a new study <a href="http://jvi.asm.org/content/early/2016/10/27/JVI.01859-16">accepted for publication in the <em>Journal of Virology</em></a>, she used x-ray crystallography to show how a specific protein structure on the surface of the virus is blocked by a neutralizing antibody, thus preventing the virus from infecting human cells.</p>
<p>"We've identified a site of vulnerability on the surface of the virus that we can now target for development of a vaccine or antiviral therapy," DuBois said. "These are the first results showing how a neutralizing antibody blocks this virus."</p>
<p><strong>&#65279;Antibody binding site</strong></p>
<p>The study shows how the antibody binds to a structure known as the astrovirus capsid spike domain, which projects from the surface of the virus. By binding to the spike domain, the antibody blocks the virus's ability to attach to and infect human cells.</p>
<p>The new findings provide a roadmap for researchers to design a vaccine based on the spike domain that can induce neutralizing antibodies and prevent infection in children. The study also highlights the potential to develop therapeutic antibodies to treat severe astrovirus infections.</p>
<p>"Antibody therapeutics is a rapidly growing field. Many immunotherapies are being developed to target cancer cells, and we expect to see a growing number of antibody therapies for infectious diseases over the next ten years," DuBois said.</p>
<p>Graduate student Walter Bogdanoff is first author of the paper. DuBois noted that the first three authors of the paper--Bogdanoff and undergraduates Jocelyn Campos and Edmundo Perez--have all been supported by the <a href="http://stemdiv.ucsc.edu/">STEM Diversity Programs</a> at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>"It's a great program that funds undergraduates and graduate students from diverse backgrounds to do laboratory research, and they really do become accomplished scientists and well prepared for graduate school and careers in science," she said.</p>
<p>The other coauthors are research associate Yu Lin and project scientist David Alexander. This research was supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and by the Hellman Fellows Fund.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="88d08ad08072701752a34ca3753f0ff9"><name>slugpride-feature-story</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Students let their Slug flags fly </title><summary>Cowell College's recent Slug Pride Night was a chance for students to celebrate the campus community and learn about student groups and activities. </summary><start-date>1479764460000</start-date><display-name>slugpride-feature-story-2016</display-name><path>/2016/11/slugpride-feature-story</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/11/slugpride-feature-story</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1479764116847</created-on><last-modified-by>dwhite1</last-modified-by><last-modified>1479776805658</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/11/images/slugpridemorecelebratns.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/11/images/slugpridemorecelebratns.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>slugpridemorecelebratns.jpg</name><display-name>slugpridemorecelebratns.jpg</display-name><file-size>49560</file-size><width>350</width><height>234</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/11/images/slugpridethumb80.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/11/images/slugpridethumb80.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>slugpridethumb80.jpg</name><display-name>slugpridethumb80.jpg</display-name><file-size>16097</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>Slug Pride Night at Cowell College was a time to celebrate Slug identity across the campus.

<p>UC Santa Cruz is famous for its college system. Students are affiliated with one of the campus&#8217;s 10 colleges, and can indicate their preferred college during the admissions process.</p>
<p>Each of those colleges puts on two to three college nights per quarter, each one embracing a different theme.</p>
<p>The evening had a few things in common with other college nights. For instance, the night included dinner, which ended with the serving of cinnamon rolls, which led to enormous but fast-moving lines.</p>
<p>But Slug Pride Night was unique in the sense that it had a distinctly inter-college theme. Part talent show, part activities fair, the night was a chance for students to embrace and honor their campuswide community while exploring the various teams and groups that enrich students&#8217; social lives at UC Santa Cruz.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted to represent Slug Pride in all its many forms on our campus and showcase a small sampling of things that students are doing outside the classroom,&#8221; said Kara Snider, college programs coordinator for Cowell College. &#8220;We hoped it would inspire students to get more involved.&#8221;</p>
<p>And students responded. The women&#8217;s soccer team and cross country team showed up to encourage other students to participate, and the crowd took in a synchronized, joyful, and eye-catching performance by Kahaani, UC Santa Cruz&#8217;s co-ed competitive Hindi-Film dance team. They performed their flashy, high-energy set in front of an inviting handmade backdrop showing a banana slug standing in a grove of construction-paper redwoods in a rain of confetti.</p>
<p>There were demonstrations of ballroom dancing, graceful aikido, and sultry tango, as well as a deadpan and funny presentation from Isabella Cook and Maddy Corich editors of the campus's satirical newspaper, <em>The Fish Rap Live!</em></p>
<p>Cook said the publication&#8217;s satirical approach &#8220;is, basically, a way to make light of all the horrible things that are going on in the world right now.&#8221; Cook and Corich got some big laughs when they recited from the latest issue, which is dedicated to the recent presidential election.</p>
<p>Everyone who attended the event got a little slip of paper shaped like a banana slug.</p>
<p>Each paper slip had a space for students to explain why they are proud to be Slugs.</p>
<p>&#8220;UC Santa Cruz embraces weirdness, and I think that&#8217;s awesome,&#8221; one student wrote.</p>
<p>Others said they were proud of their Slug-ness &#8220;because UC Santa Cruz is rad,&#8221; &#8220;because I love the forest and the ocean,&#8221; and &#8220;because the trees are absolutely heart-melting.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="8979b6b18072701752a34ca34e33c4a5"><name>harvest-dinner-feature-story</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>A Thanksgiving bounty for non-traveling Slugs </title><summary>A hungry crowd of 600 people is expected at UC Santa Cruz’s third-annual Harvest Dinner on campus Thanksgiving Day at College Nine/Ten Dining Hall.</summary><start-date>1479775200000</start-date><display-name>harvest-dinner-on-thanksgiving-day</display-name><path>/2016/11/harvest-dinner-feature-story</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/11/harvest-dinner-feature-story</link><created-by>dwhite1</created-by><created-on>1479775203712</created-on><last-modified-by>clagattu</last-modified-by><last-modified>1479845182946</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Dan White</name><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/11/images/pumpkin-photo-UCSC.jpg</path><link>site://news/2016/11/images/pumpkin-photo-UCSC.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>pumpkin-photo-UCSC.jpg</name><display-name>pumpkin-photo-UCSC.jpg</display-name><file-size>43705</file-size><width>400</width><height>267</height></image><image-alt/><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/11/images/pumpkin-photo-thumbnail</path><link>site://news/2016/11/images/pumpkin-photo-thumbnail</link><site>news</site><name>pumpkin-photo-thumbnail</name><display-name>pumpkin-photo-thumbnail</display-name><file-size>14396</file-size></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption>The Harvest Dinner will provide a touch of fall cheer for those who stay on campus during the Thanksgiving Break.

<p>Doors open at noon on Thanksgiving&#8212;and there will be two seatings for the meal: noon to 2 p.m. for early birds and 2 to 4 p.m. for other diners.</p>
<p>This fall tradition started in 2013 at the request of Faye Crosby, Cowell College provost at the time, who wanted the campus to offer conviviality, companionship, and good food to students, staff, and faculty who stick around during the four-day Thanksgiving break, when most of the population clears out and the bustling campus can feel isolating.</p>
<p>While the dorms stay open, and residential life staff members stick around, most of the campus services shut down. All restaurants close. The libraries lock their doors.</p>
<p>In other words, life can feel lonely for some members of the UC Santa Cruz community who stay on campus because getting home for the holidays is logistically difficult or too expensive, or perhaps there isn't a "home" to go to.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some students may not have the resources or opportunity to go home with families around the holiday,&#8221; said Lucy Rojas, interim dean of students. Some international students come here from as far away as India and China, and for them, going home for a few days isn't feasible.</p>
<p>In the midst of this quiet campus, the Harvest Dinner provides a warm and welcoming environment, along with a holiday feast that covers all the important bases, regardless of dietary preferences: turkey breast, Tofurkey roast, vegan mashed potatoes, vegan gravy, honey-glazed ham, stuffing, macaroni and cheese, butternut squash, green bean casserole with friend onions, cranberry sauce, dinner rolls, pie, and, of course, Martinelli&#8217;s sparkling cider.</p>
<p>While taking their meal, diners will socialize, reminisce, and look at handouts that talk about how countries across the world have holidays that are similar to Thanksgiving&#8212;for instance, the August Moon festival in China and the &#8220;fall evening&#8221; festival in Korea.</p>
<p>Since its inception, the Harvest Dinner has become more popular. &#8220;When it first started, it was somewhat informal, and there were 100 people, &#8221; said Rojas. Then attendance doubled last year, and has gotten even larger this year.</p>
<p>Monday, November 21, is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc6ZXF67LMvt4zespZfeA7Bu0dJRrQLf6gRoed9Z9HeIKpjtA/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1">last day to make reservations.</a> The cost is one swipe for meal-plan holders.</p>

 <br/>
 The day after the presidential election, the 10 University of California chancellors and UC President Janet Napolitano issued a <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/university-california-statement-election">statement</a> to underscore their unwavering support for all members of our community in accord with the UC&#8217;s <a href="http://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/aar/mare.pdf">Principles Against Intolerance</a>. As the principles make clear, the university &#8220;strives to foster an environment in which all are included&#8221; and &#8220;all are given an equal opportunity to learn and explore&#8221; free of harassment based on immigration status, racial/ethnic background, religion, sexual orientation, or political views.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 Particularly since the election, there have been disturbing reports from across the nation of intimidation, harassment, and, in some cases, violence against individuals and targeted groups. If this has happened to you, or if you have witnessed such incidents, we encourage you to file a report with the UC Santa Cruz Police Department [emergency phone: 911, phone: 831-459-2231, email: <a href="mailto:police@ucsc.edu">police@ucsc.edu</a>, website: <a href="http://police.ucsc.edu">http://police.ucsc.edu</a>] or through the <a href="http://reporthate.ucsc.edu/">hate/bias reporting site</a> so that these incidents can be thoroughly investigated. Other campus resources include: <a href="http://eop.ucsc.edu/undocumented_student_services/index.html">Undocumented Student Services</a>, located within the Educational Opportunity Programs office, <a href="http://eop.ucsc.edu/undocumented_student_services/Immigration%20Legal%20Services%20Resources.html">Immigration Legal Service Resources</a>, and <a href="http://caps.ucsc.edu/counseling/index.html">Counseling and Psychological Services</a>.<br/>
 &#160;<br/>
 Many of our students have expressed uncertainty and fear over possible changes to federal immigration policies that may directly affect them and/or their families, as well as the university as a whole. To address this issue, President Napolitano has convened a working group to develop the best and most effective responses by UC to possible changes to federal immigration policies under the incoming administration. The unequivocal goal of these efforts is to protect all members of our community and ensure their continued success at the university. The working group is moving quickly, and we will keep you posted about its efforts.<br/>
 <br/>
 In the meantime, let us continue our interactions with one another in the spirit of respect and cooperation. As noted in the Principles Against Intolerance, &#8220;(we are) best served when members of the university community collaborate to foster an equal learning environment for all, in which all members of the community are welcomed and confident of their physical safety.&#8221;</article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>UC Santa Cruz Campus Community</audience><admin>Jaye Padgett, Interim Vice Provost for Student Success, and Lucy Rojas, Interim Dean of Students</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="acb29a498072701752a34ca31c33485c"><name>photo-contest</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>2016 photo contest winner</title><summary>There were over 100 entries this year in the chancellor's holiday photo contest.

<p>Elevation to the grade of fellow is a prestigious honor conferred by the IEEE Board of Directors on members with an outstanding record of accomplishments. The total number selected in any one year cannot exceed one-tenth of one percent of the total voting membership.</p>
<p>Schmidt, who directs the <a href="https://cfno.soe.ucsc.edu/">W. M. Keck Center for Nanoscale Optofluidics</a> at UC Santa Cruz, was honored "for contributions to optofluidics and integrated photonics." He has authored or coauthored over 380 publications and several book chapters in various fields of optics, and he is coeditor of the <em>Handbook of Optofluidics</em> (CRC Press). Schmidt and his collaborators have developed technologies for optical analysis of samples on integrated chip-based platforms, with applications in areas such as biological sensors, virus detection, and chemical analysis. Diagnostic instruments based on these "optofluidic chips" could provide a rapid, low-cost, and portable option for identifying specific disease-related molecules or viruses.</p>
<p>Schmidt joins ten other UCSC engineering faculty who are IEEE Fellows. He earned his M.S. in physics from the University of Stuttgart, Germany, and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering at UC Santa Barbara. He joined the faculty of the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz in 2001.</p>
<p>The IEEE is the world's leading professional association dedicated to the advancement of technology. The IEEE publishes 30 percent of the world's literature in the electrical and electronics engineering and computer science fields, and has developed more than 1300 active industry standards.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="acf707c98072701752a34ca3f40089b9"><name>paytan-aslo-fellow</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Marine scientist Adina Paytan named 2016 ASLO Fellow</title><summary>Paytan will be honored as a fellow of the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO).</summary><keywords>Adina Paytan</keywords><start-date>1480320000000</start-date><display-name>Marine scientist Adina Paytan named 2016 ASLO Fellow</display-name><path>/2016/11/paytan-aslo-fellow</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/11/paytan-aslo-fellow</link><created-by>stephens</created-by><created-on>1480370618960</created-on><last-modified-by>stephens</last-modified-by><last-modified>1480370757942</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Physical and Biological Sciences</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name><value>Marine Science</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Tim Stephens</name><title></title><phone/><email>stephens@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/05/images/adina-lobster-300.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/05/images/adina-lobster-300.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>adina-lobster-300.jpg</name><display-name>adina-lobster-300.jpg</display-name><file-size>64307</file-size><width>300</width><height>224</height></image><image-alt>Adina Paytan</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2014/05/images/adina-lobster-thumb.jpg</path><link>site://news/2014/05/images/adina-lobster-thumb.jpg</link><site>news</site><name>adina-lobster-thumb.jpg</name><display-name>adina-lobster-thumb.jpg</display-name><file-size>20780</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt>Adina Paytan</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Adina Paytan</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Adina Paytan, a research scientist in the Institute of Marine Sciences at UC Santa Cruz, has been named a fellow of the <a href="http://aslo.org/index.php">Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography</a> (ASLO).</p>
<p>ASLO Fellows are recognized as having achieved excellence in their contributions to ASLO and the aquatic sciences. The 2016 ASLO Fellows will be honored at the ASLO Meeting in Honolulu, Hawaii, in February 2017.</p>
<p>Paytan studies chemical and biological processes in the oceans, how they have changed over time, and how they are affected by human activities. Her research addresses a wide range of questions involving the global systems that affect ocean productivity, seawater chemistry, nutrient cycles, and water pollution. An over-arching goal of her lab's research is to link changes observed in the Earth and ocean systems to global changes in climate and tectonics, with an emphasis on human impacts.</p>
<p>Paytan is also dedicated to science education and outreach. She devotes time to develop and implement programs that enhance the process of learning science, expose students at all levels to the excitement of doing science, and introduce the relevance of science to real-world problems and current issues.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="ad4e30978072701752a34ca3ee46821c"><name>barad-europe-honors</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Feminist studies professor Karen Barad receives multiple honors in Europe</title><summary>Karen Barad--professor of feminist studies, philosophy, and history of consciousness at UC Santa Cruz--also happens to have a Ph.D. in theoretical particle physics and quantum field theory... </summary><keywords>uc santa cruz, ucsc karen barad, agenital realism, science and justice, feminist studies</keywords><start-date>1480377300000</start-date><display-name>Feminist studies professor Karen Barad receives multiple honors in Europe</display-name><path>/2016/11/barad-europe-honors</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/11/barad-europe-honors</link><created-by>srapp</created-by><created-on>1480376331078</created-on><last-modified-by>srapp</last-modified-by><last-modified>1480377332994</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name><value>Humanities</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name><value>Philosophy</value><value>History of Consciousness</value><value>Feminist Studies</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name><value>About UCSC</value><value>Research</value><value>Admissions</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name><value>Faculty</value><value>Community</value><value>Graduate Students</value><value>Undergraduates</value><value>International</value><value>Alumni</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Press Release</value><value>Awards and Honors</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name><value>Social Consciousness</value><value>Interdisciplinary</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name><value>Secondary Story</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name>Scott Rappaport</name><title></title><phone/><email>srapp@ucsc.edu</email></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/11/images/barad-sweden-350.png</path><link>site://news/2016/11/images/barad-sweden-350.png</link><site>news</site><name>barad-sweden-350.png</name><display-name>barad-sweden-350.png</display-name><file-size>176693</file-size><width>350</width><height>259</height></image><image-alt> Karen Barad received an honorary doctorate in the Arts at the University of Gothenburg in</image-alt><image-thumb type="file"><content></content><path>/2016/11/images/barad-thumb.png</path><link>site://news/2016/11/images/barad-thumb.png</link><site>news</site><name>barad-thumb.png</name><display-name>barad-thumb.png</display-name><file-size>33000</file-size><width>80</width><height>80</height></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt> Karen Barad received an honorary doctorate in the Arts at the University of Gothenburg in</image-thumb-alt><image-caption>Karen Barad received an honorary doctorate in the Arts at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden.</image-caption></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>Karen Barad--professor of feminist studies, philosophy, and history of consciousness at UC Santa Cruz--also happens to have a Ph.D. in theoretical particle physics and quantum field theory.&#160;</p>
<p>The author of&#160;<em>Meeting the Universe Halfway: Quantum Physics and the Entanglement of Matter and Meaning</em>, she has published numerous articles in the fields of physics, philosophy, science studies, and feminist theory.&#160;</p>
<p>She also serves as co-director of the Science &amp; Justice Training Program at UC Santa Cruz. A unique graduate-level research and education program, its mission is &#8220;to train science and engineering students, alongside social science and humanities students, to identify and respond to moments where research requires attentiveness to questions of policy, ethics, and justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the past month, Barad has received multiple honors in Europe for her work. She first received an honorary doctorate in the Arts at the University of Gothenburg (Sweden), followed the next day by a symposium&#160;held in her honor, titled&#160;&#8220;How Matter Comes to Matter,"&#160;on her theory of agential realism.</p>
<p>A few days later, a conference was held in her honor at the University of Aarhus in Denmark. She then&#160;presented&#160;the&#160;Futures Lecture at that institution, a series that seeks to present some of the most interesting thinkers in the realms of the arts, humanities, and social sciences. The title of her talk was &#8220;Troubling Time/s, Undoing and Re-membering the Future&#8221;.</p>
<p>Finally, on her flight back home, she learned that she had received an invitation to be on the summer faculty of the European Graduate School,&#160;founded in Switzerland by the non-profit European Foundation of Interdisciplinary Studies.&#160;</p>
<p>&#8220;I spent the first half of my career in a physics department,&#8221; Barad noted. &#8220;But I was interested in asking larger questions, including questions of social justice in relation to science, and I found a lot of resources in thinking about philosophy and other aspects of the humanities and social sciences."</p>
<p>&#8220;I never left physics,&#8221; she added. &#8220;My research engages questions of the foundations of quantum physics and questions of social justice. The pressing problems of the world don&#8217;t fit inside individual academic disciplines or divisions, and so I have been working to develop ideas that speak across these divisions&#160;we call the natural sciences, the humanities, the social sciences and the arts."&#160;</p>
<p>As University of Aarhus professor Andreas Roepstorff noted in the introduction to Barad&#8217;s recent Futures Lecture in Denmark: &#8220;This mixture of rigor coming from physics and imagination coming from the humanities--trying to grapple with problems that are so complex that even thinking of them blows up your mind---is where Karen Barad is really making a massive contribution.&#8221;</p>

The campus food drive works with Second Harvest Food Bank of Santa Cruz County to provide healthy meals to our friends and neighbors in need.</p>
<p>You can donate by barrel, online, or donation envelopes found at campus mailstops.</p>
<p>Your donations are secure through campus mail services. Donation envelopes are being distributed this week. Please make checks payable to Second Harvest Food Bank and mark your affiliation on the memo line.</p>
<p>You can learn more about the drive and how to make <a href="http://holidayfooddrive.ucsc.edu">donations at our website</a>.</p>
<p>Last year the UC Santa Cruz holiday food drive gave more than 150,000 meals to our friends and neighbors in need, making the campus the third-largest contributor in the county.</p>
<p>We are honored to work in cooperation with Second Harvest Food Bank of Santa Cruz, the healthiest food bank in the nation. With its buying power, Second Harvest distributes more than 60 percent of meals in the form of fresh fruits and vegetables.</p>
<p>Second Harvest recognizes the importance of eating smart and it's long-term connection to the health of our community. Your pantry donations go a long way, but your envelope donations can go further with a lower carbon footprint. One hundred percent of your donation is used to feed people in need in our community, and just one dollar feeds a family of four.</p>
<p>Please make a donation to support this great cause either in one of our campus pantry barrels or by using the donation envelopes distributed through campus mail.</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued support. If you would like to get involved with the food drive, please contact:</p>

<p>The ACL Fellows program recognizes members for extraordinary contributions to the field. Walker was honored "for fundamental contributions to statistical methods for dialog optimization, to centering theory, and to expressive generation for dialog."</p>
<p>Walker is head of the <a href="https://nlds.soe.ucsc.edu/">Natural Language and Dialogue Systems Lab</a> in the Baskin School of Engineering at UC Santa Cruz. Her current research includes work on computational models of dialogue interaction and conversational agents; analysis of affect, sarcasm and other social phenomena in social media dialogue; acquiring causal knowledge from text; conversational summarization; interactive story and narrative generation; and statistical methods for training the dialogue manager and the language generation engine for dialogue systems.</p>
<p>Before coming to Santa Cruz in 2009, Walker was a professor of computer science at the University of Sheffield. From 1996 to 2003, she was a principal member of the research staff at AT&amp;T Bell Labs and AT&amp;T Research, where she worked on the AT&amp;T Communicator project, developing a new architecture for spoken dialogue systems and statistical methods for dialogue management and generation. Walker has published more than 200 papers and has 10 U.S. patents granted or pending. She earned a B.A. in computer and information science at UC Santa Cruz, M.S. in computer science at Stanford University, and M.A. in linguistics and Ph.D. in computer science at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) is the premier international scientific and professional society for people working on computational problems involving human language, a field often referred to as either computational linguistics or natural language processing.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2014/09/marilyn-walker.html</url><title>Teaching

the UC Santa Cruz admissions office as a front line advisor in September 1981 enrollment was &#8220;about 6,500&#8221; and desktop computers were just coming in. (The &#8220;about 6,500" is used because back then no one knew for sure.)</p>
<p>McCawley, director of admissions for the past five years, just celebrated his 35<sup>th</sup> year at UC Santa Cruz, all in admissions. And he isn&#8217;t even the longest serving staffer in the office. David Kamimoto, associate director of admissions for transfer preparation programs, began a year earlier as an admissions counselor in the Los Angeles area.</p>
<p>That McCawley and Kamimoto have more than 71 years of service to students and families is testament to their dedication to higher education, said Michelle Whittingham, associate vice chancellor of enrollment management.</p>
<p>McCawley has been a special programs assistant, application processing coordinator, associate director, and acting director (twice) before becoming director in December 2011. Over the years, he has been in hundreds of California high schools, attended college fairs across the state, visited nearly all of the state&#8217;s 113 community colleges, and traveled to Canada, Mexico, and India on UC Santa Cruz business.</p>
<p>&#8220;Michael is one of the most well-known admissions counselors in the state of California,&#8221; Whittingham said. &#8220;He has a tireless dedication to the work we do, and has had an impact on many, many students and families.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every fall opening is a celebration to me,&#8221; McCawley said. &#8220;Watching the campus grow in its ethnic and cultural diversity is particularly gratifying. As I look back, I'll always appreciate the incredible individuals that I've had the good fortune of working with over my career,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>McCawley called the growth in California community college transfer students &#8220;an amazing occurrence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kamimoto has worked with community college transfers for nearly 20 years in admissions and the Education Partnership Center where he became director of a transfer preparation program launched in 1999, after the passage three years earlier of Proposition 209 that prohibited considering race, gender, or ethnicity in public education. He moved back to admissions in 2012.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of the same concerns still come up for students today,&#8221; Kamimoto said, noting educational financing, preparation for a career or graduate school, ability to get classes, and graduating in a timely manner.&#160; &#8220;One of the differences now, though, is that we now have many UCSC alumni who are parents of students who are considering us, and they have specific expectations, influenced by their own memories, of their children.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kamimoto also toasted his colleague. &#8220;It has been great to work with Michael over the course of our admissions careers,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think we were both given opportunities, as well as support, from those around us, that have allowed us to be successful and contribute to the overall campus in our roles.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b1c6ee018072701752a34ca30f81ace0"><name>parking-scotts-valley-center</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Parking and transportation at Scotts Valley Center</title><summary>As the move to the Scotts Valley Center approaches, we wanted to share important updates about transportation and parking.</summary><start-date>1479456000000</start-date><display-name>Scotts Valley Center</display-name><path>/2016/11/parking-scotts-valley-center</path><site>news</site><link>site://news/2016/11/parking-scotts-valley-center</link><created-by>shj</created-by><created-on>1480451351969</created-on><last-modified-by>shj</last-modified-by><last-modified>1480451351969</last-modified><dynamic-metadata><name>category-divisions</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-arts</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-engineering</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-humanities</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-pbsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-socsci</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-landing-pages</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-audience</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-activity</name><value>Administrative Message</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-values</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-topics</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-placement</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>type</name><value>Regular News</value></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>category-profile</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>site-url</name></dynamic-metadata><dynamic-metadata><name>number-displayed</name></dynamic-metadata><system-data-structure definition-path="Campus Home Environment/News Article"><contact><name/><title></title><phone/><email/></contact><video><embed/><width/><caption></caption></video><lead-image><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-thumb><path>/</path></image-thumb><image-thumb-alt/><image-caption/></lead-image><secondary-images><image><path>/</path></image><image-alt/><image-caption/></secondary-images><article-subhead/><article-text><p>As the move to the Scotts Valley Center approaches, we wanted to share important updates about transportation and parking.</p>
<p><strong>Parking at Scotts Valley Center</strong></p>
<p>Staff will not have to pay for parking at the Scotts Valley Center, and there will be 370 spaces reserved specifically for UCSC based on the square footage we're leasing. Office buildings are required by code to provide 3 spaces for every 1,000 foot of office space, and this parking allocation conforms to that standard. We will have access to parking both underneath modules E and F (first come, first served) as well as in surface lots. We will be issuing permits to staff working at SVC for the staff parking, and the building also has spaces for visitor parking.</p>
<p>There will be approximately 350 staff working at the Scotts Valley Center; given that we will have vanpools and some staff carpool, and given that some people typically utilize alternative transportation or are out of the office on a given day, our requirements will be met by the parking spaces provided. Visitors will be able to utilize visitor parking spaces at the front of the building.</p>
<strong>Other transportation options</strong> 
<p>The staff survey administered by UCSC Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) showed that there wouldn't be sufficient demand to support a traditional shuttle service. However, the campus will be offering several options to help employees get to the Scotts Valley Center and conduct university business. Those options include van pools, ZimRides, landlord-sponsored Uber service, and Zip Cars, and are described below.</p>
<p>UC Santa Cruz staff and student employees will be able to use Uber for transportation between the Scotts Valley Center and the main campus for business purposes. Staff will be able to book rides online or through the iOS and Android app, which would be charged directly to the campus.</p>
<p>However, the landlord is open to increasing the level of service, if the Uber program is found not to be meeting the campus's needs. UCSC will conduct surveys to provide insight into the quality and efficacy of the Uber service once we have some experience with it.</p>
<p>With the investment in videoconferencing technology and the anticipated change in expectations for required in-person meetings, we hope to reduce the need for travel, which is both good for the environment and cuts down on time spent going from place to place.</p>
<p>Additionally, UCSC will be setting up a ZipCar pod with usage to be paid directly by departments. The ZipCar can also be used by staff for personal trips.</p>
<p>UCSC is in the process of creating van pools to support commuter transportation to the Scotts Valley Center from various locations. If you are interested in participating as a rider, driver, or backup driver on one of these new van pool routes, please complete the follow-up survey. Also, carpools can be facilitated through an online rideshare/carpool organizational tool already available at UCSC via Zimride (https://www.zimride.com/ucsc/).</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience>Staff in BAS, ITS, and UR</audience><admin>Lisa Akeson, Director, Real Estate Office; and Larry Pageler, Director, Transportation and Parking Services</admin></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b1d53b568072701752a34ca364a0e961"><name>title-ix</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Title IX office adds investigators, plans campaign to raise awareness of domestic and dating violence</title><summary>When Tracey Tsugawa arrived at UC Santa Cruz in August 2014 she was more than simply the new campus Title IX Officer.

She was the entire Title IX office.</p>
<p>Today, Tsugawa and a staff of four handle a growing number of reports of sexual harassment and sexual violence. The office was expanded over the summer after Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Alison Galloway committed additional funding.</p>
<p>Anna Bartkowski, Isabel Dees, and Ray Lader joined the team this fall as complaint resolution officers and Laura Young-Hinck continues to serve as response team coordinator.</p>
<p>In addition to new resources, the campus Title IX office has been moved into Business and Administrative Services, headed by Vice Chancellor Sarah Latham.</p>
<p>Title IX is a 1972 federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in an education program or activity that receives federal funding. Under Title IX, sexual harassment, which includes sexual violence, is a form of unlawful sex discrimination.</p>
<h2>Unprecedented attention</h2>
<p>Tsugawa&#8217;s hiring two years ago occurred as unprecedented attention began to focus on sexual violence and sexual harassment on college campuses nationwide. Several high-profile incidents made national headlines. New federal and state laws were passed.</p>
<p>In January 2014, President Obama announced the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault. Six months later UC President Janet Napolitano formed the President&#8217;s Task Force on Preventing and Responding to Sexual Violence and Sexual Assault, pledging to be &#8220;the national leader in preventing and combating sexual violence and sexual assault.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Task force mandates</h2>
<p>Napolitano&#8217;s task force generated eight new mandates for all UC campuses and revised the UC Policy on Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment. One mandate calls for increasing public awareness. Last year, the Title IX office and campus partners created a campus-wide awareness campaign around the concept of &#8220;consent.&#8221; This year, the campaign will focus on dating and domestic violence after the number of dating and domestic violence reports nearly doubled from 16 in 2014-2015 to 31 in the 2015-2016 academic year.</p>
<p>Although a relatively small percentage of total reports, the dating/domestic violence incidents are serious, Tsugawa said. &#8220;These cases often involve complainants who end up in the hospital and respondents who face criminal charges,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The increase in reports of these incidents prompted us to revise our education and outreach work to increase knowledge and awareness of the issue; too often it remains hidden or goes unreported.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Reports more than double</h2>
<p>The number of Title IX complaints at UC Santa Cruz has more than doubled since 2013-14, more a reflection of increased awareness than an increase in incidents, Tsugawa said. Her predecessor received 85 reports during her final year (2013-14) and conducted four formal investigations. In her first year (2014-15), Tsugawa received 181 reports and her office conducted 22 investigations. In her second (2015-16), she received 233 reports and opened 46 formal investigations.</p>
<p>So far this year, the Title IX office has received almost twice the number of reports as the same time last year. Tsugawa views the increase as a good sign. &#8220;People are more willing to report incidents, and with three new investigators we can now respond faster to these reports,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Hopefully people are feeling less alone.&#8221; Tsugawa also noted that based on statistics reflected in recent national research, the increase in reports likely reflects only a small percent of what is actually happening on college campuses.&#160;</p>
<h2>Alternative resolutions</h2>
<p>Despite an increase in reporting, Tsugawa said there are still many misconceptions about what the Title IX office does. &#8220;We don&#8217;t automatically launch an investigation,&#8221; she said, &#8220;there are options, including alternative resolutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Generally, a complainant can choose which option they would like as a response to a report of sexual violence or sexual harassment. However, there are some circumstances in which an investigation may be required, such as cases of physical violence or when there are multiple reports of allegations by the same person. &#8220;When there are imminent safety concerns or a larger pattern that needs to be addressed, we may need to conduct what we call a &#8216;Title IX-initiated investigation&#8217; without a particular complainant,&#8221; Tsugawa said.</p>
<p>About 20 percent of people who make a report request a formal investigation, while others seek an alternative resolution. Alternative resolutions may include requests for housing changes, no-contact directives, or academic adjustments. &#8220;Our responsibility is to make sure students are safe while they're here,&#8221; Tsugawa said. &#8220;If someone does not feel safe, they cannot focus on learning and working.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Graduate students&#8217; unique concerns</h2>
<p>About 85 percent of complaints arise from students about other students, but the Title IX office also serves staff and faculty. Graduate students, who are both students and campus employees, have unique concerns, Tsugawa said. They can be on the receiving end of harassment from a faulty member, staff member, or another student. And, as employees who teach, they also have mandatory reporting responsibilities if something is reported to them.</p>
<p>Also, for grad students who may have experienced unwanted attention from, or gender-biased treatment by, a faculty member, reporting &#8220;can be especially difficult because that professor may have such a huge influence on a graduate student&#8217;s academic career,&#8221; Tsugawa said. &#8220;There is just so much at stake for them.&#8221; &#160;She said the Title IX office works with graduate students to determine the best approach to keep them safe and address their unique concerns.</p>
<h2>Resources for additional training</h2>
<p>The newly expanded Title IX office will also mean additional training for students, staff and faculty. &#8220;This is a big change; it&#8217;s a substantial investment and commitment to the Title IX program and will directly support increased training and case management,&#8221; Latham said.</p>
<div>
<p>Tsugawa said she and her staff work closely with many partners on campus and in the community to build a stronger culture of reporting, response, and support. &#8220;We would not be able to do the work without the amazing relationships with allies on this campus,&#8221; Tsugawa said. &#8220;It makes a huge difference in our ability to respond to reports.&#8221;</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>TO REPORT:</strong> To report a possible Title IX violation involving sexual harassment, sex discrimination, or sexual violence (sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking), contact Tracey Tsugawa at 831-459-2462 or ttsugawa@ucsc.edu.</p>

<p>Then she met a mentor who turned her college career around. Miriam Ellis, Rothschild&#8217;s kind, gentle, and wise French instructor, took Rothschild under her wing, helping her undertake an ambitious translation project for her senior thesis and find her way on campus.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s Rothschild&#8217;s turn to take Ellis under her wing. More than 30 years after Ellis&#8217;s kindness made such a difference in her college experience, Rothschild has made a gift to endow <a href="http://language.ucsc.edu/news-events/news/news-article.html">the Miriam Ellis International Playhouse,</a> an annual&#160;program of short theater pieces staged in different languages by students in the university&#8217;s Language Program&#160;<em>(</em>now the Department of Languages and Applied Linguistics.)</p>
<p>Ellis planted the seeds for the playhouse in 1972 when she started offering an annual&#160;program&#160;of theater and music in French at UC Santa Cruz. The expanded playhouse, created in 2001, often performs to capacity crowds and has run productions in Chinese, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. Students perform in several languages on the same bill, with English supertitles making the works accessible to audiences.</p>
<p>Rothschild&#8217;s $250,000 gift will allow the high-quality theater with a modest annual operating budget to keep going indefinitely, covering costs to put on productions, as well as staffing.&#160;&#8220;I feel so strongly about this because, in the two years I was there at UC Santa Cruz, Miriam Ellis was such a big support to me,&#8221; Rothschild said.</p>
<p>Rothschild has many stories about Ellis helping her out in large and small ways.&#160;She was born in Holland, and had no context for certain American educational traditions, including Phi Beta Kappa, the society for academic high achievers.&#160;When she received a letter informing her that she had been selected for this coveted honor, she automatically assumed she was being courted to join a sorority.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought I was getting pledged!&#8221; Rothschild said. &#8220;Miriam Ellis told me, 'No, no, no, this is an honors society. You need to join.' She taught me to think in a wider scope&#8212;that this was not just about me, that I was a woman getting an academic honor, and there were larger implications.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ellis is thrilled by the recent gift, and by the chance to reconnect with Rothschild, whom she remembers as an early re-entry student, balancing the demands of family and studies. &#8220;Life can be very serendipitous,&#8221; Ellis remarked.</p>
<p>The endowment should go a long way, considering the theater productions are&#160;&#8220;minimalist,&#8221; Ellis said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got a couple of chairs, a table, a door that often doesn&#8217;t open and close. That&#8217;s it. It&#8217;s not a spectacle, nor is it supposed to be. It&#8217;s about the students, the language, and the culture they are sharing with the audience. It&#8217;s about young people wearing 17th-century costumes and interpreting rhymed couplets. It&#8217;s also about original productions created by students and faculty working together--such as a musical in Japanese that reflects American traditions from that culture&#8217;s perspective. But much more importantly, it&#8217;s about multicultural, multilingual views of the human condition and the ties that bind us together in shared experiences, no matter who we are or how great our differences seem to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>The campus ranked No. 10 on the list of Doctoral/Research Institutions and was the only University of California campus on that list. The Chronicle of Higher Education recently featured this list as well as ones for master&#8217;s, baccalaureate, and associate institutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Campus sustainability in operations and academics is key to a successful experience for students while they are part of our campus community, and even more important as our students move on to shape our future as global citizens," said Elida Erickson, director of the Sustainability Office.</p>
<p>For its efforts to save water and manage rainwater, UC Santa Cruz ranked No. 4 on a water sustainability list. Additionally, the campus tied for No. 3 on an investment and finance list.</p>
<p>&#8220;Institutions with transparent and democratic investment processes promote accountability and engagement by the campus and community,&#8221; the report notes. "By using the tools of sustainable investment and disclosure, institutions can improve the long-term health of their endowments, encourage better corporate behavior, support innovation in sustainable products and services, support sustainability in their community, and help build a more just and sustainable financial system."</p>
<p>The Climate and Energy Strategy and Roadmap to Carbon Neutrality developed by UC Santa Cruz were also featured in the report.</p>
<p>The 2016 Sustainable Campus Index (SCI) recognizes top-performing colleges and universities in 17 distinct aspects of sustainability, as measured by the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment &amp; Rating System (STARS). The rating system evaluated the 249 institutions that submitted a valid Stars Version 2 report between July 1, 2013 and June 30, 2016.</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="b7d9309e8072701752a34ca33c276486"><name>slavery-atlantic-world</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Students shed new light on slavery by mixing archaeological data with historical records </title><summary>Using a blend of data, history, and archaeology, UC Santa Cruz undergraduates have explored what life as a slave was like on plantations in the American South.

They shared their research findings in an interactive poster session this week.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The presentations are part of the fall quarter class</span> "<span>Slavery in the Atlantic World</span><span>,"&#160; co-taught by archeologist and anthropology professor J. Cameron Monroe and history professor Greg O&#8217;Malley. This is the second time the professors have taught the course.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Historically, slaves were depicted as only labor and numbers, with very little, if any, information about their personal life. &#160;&#8220;The history of slavery was written by people in power,&#8221; Monroe says.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>But now with data recently made available by</span> <a href="http://www.daacs.org"><span>the Digital Archaeological Archive of Comparative Slavery</span></a> <span>(DAACS) and the</span> <a href="http://www.slavevoyages.org"><span>Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade Database</span></a><span>, students in Monroe and O&#8217;Malley&#8217;s interdisciplinary class can piece together archaeological records with historical analysis to explore the human side of captive life.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;Now, we can correct the legacy of dehumanizing slavery,&#8221; Monroe said about ways an archaeological perspective can complement what these databases can offer. &#160;As Monroe and O&#8217;Malley share, some scholars see the database as controversial because it reduces slaves&#8217; experiences to numbers, ultimately dehumanizing the slave trade. However, when a qualitative analysis is introduced, students can account for a richer reflection of a slave's lived experience.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>As part of his group project, Harrison Sater (Porter &#8217;17, anthropology) examined pottery fragments to better understand material culture in the slave quarters at Thomas Jefferson&#8217;s plantation, Monticello, located outside of Charlottesville, Va. His group found there were more earthenware bowls than porcelain plates in kitchens. This indicated to him that slaves ate more soups and stews, typical of their native West African cuisine. This also revealed that slaves were given an illusion of agency to maintain certain cultural traditions in their new life.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>But establishing an illusion of autonomy was central for slave owners. Letting slaves think they had certain freedoms was really just another way for plantation owners to control them, says anthropology major Alyssa Robleza (Oakes &#8217;17), whose group studied the ways Jefferson manipulated the environment to convince slaves to not escape at his Virginian retreat at Poplar Forest.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>For example, Robleza and her peers followed hedge patterns to show the various ways Jefferson &#160;isolated slaves from seeing the external world. By not being able to see outside life, they would not be tempted to escape, says critical race and ethnic studies major Kadijah Means. And because of their insular life, slaves could also form attachments and families, which would also increase their likelihood to stay put.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The groups also used archaeological artifacts to study how slaves might have resisted their captors.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;Ceramics, work material, and bottles of alcohol remains found in these pits show evidence of pilferage,&#8221; says Sater.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Students said that the pilfered items in these subfloor pits, special hiding places in slave quarters, were used for planning small revolts.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;Artifacts like sharp bricks and bullets may be evidence of plans for rebellion,&#8221; Sater adds.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&#8220;Archaeology has the potential to democratize history,&#8221; Monroe says.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Other groups looked how the division of labor was split on plantations, how free time could be determined through artifacts, how slaves communicated with slaves at other plantations, and how they actively supplemented dietary rations through hunting.</span></p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://</url><title></title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="dbe4c1bd8072701752a34ca31ee9eeab"><name>global-women-worldwide</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>Alumna Kate Schatz pens second NY Times bestseller with ‘Rad Women Worldwide’</title><summary>Rad Women Worldwide, the follow-up to UC Santa Cruz alumna Kate Schatz’s New York Times bestselling book Rad American Women A-Z, is a showcase of extraordinary women from 31 countries around the world.&#13;

<hr/>
<p><em><strong>Rad Women Worldwide</strong></em>--the follow-up to UC Santa Cruz alumna Kate Schatz&#8217;s <em>New York Times</em> bestselling book <strong><em>Rad American Women A-Z</em></strong>&#8212;is a showcase of extraordinary women from 31 countries around the world.</p>
<p>The new book features inspired stories of perseverance and radical success, combining well researched profiles with expressive cut-paper portraits by artist Miriam Klein Stahl.</p>
<p>The women featured range from <strong>Liv Arnesen</strong> and <strong>Ann Bancroft</strong> (polar explorers and the first women to cross Antarctica), to <strong>Malala Yousafzai</strong> (the youngest person to win the Nobel Peace Prize), to <strong>Poly Styrene</strong> (singer-songwriter and lead singer for the punk rock band X-Ray Spex).</p>
<p>The book also includes <strong>Josephine Baker</strong> (dancer, singer, actress and civil rights activist), <strong>Frida Kahlo</strong> (artist and activist), <strong>Hatshepsut</strong> (pharaoh and king of ancient Egypt), <strong>Maria Montessori</strong> (physician and founder of the Montessori philosophy of education), <strong>Sophie Scholl</strong> (student and anti-Nazi political activist within the White Rose non-violent resistance group in Nazi Germany), and <strong>Kasha Jacqueline Nagabasera</strong> (Ugandan LGBTI rights activist).</p>
<p>The aim of the book is to illustrate the immense range of what women have done and can do. As a bonus, Schatz adds an additional 250 names of &#8220;international rad women&#8221; as a reference for readers to continue their own research.</p>
<p>And in its first week of publication, <em>Rad Women Worldwide</em> debuted at #8 on the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller list for Children&#8217;s Middle Grade Hardcover books.</p>
<p><strong>A graduate of UC Santa Cruz in 2001</strong> with a B.A. in Women&#8217;s Studies and Creative Writing, Schatz is a writer, editor, educator, left-handed vegetarian, and feminist activist. Her work of fiction, <em>Rid of Me: A Story</em>, was published in 2006 as part of the acclaimed 33 1/3 series, and her short story &#8220;Folsom, Survivor&#8221; was included as a &#8220;Notable Short Story&#8221; in <em>Best American Short Stories 2011</em>.</p>
<p>Schatz is also the former Chair of the School of Literary Arts at Oakland School for the Arts, where she taught fiction, poetry, and journalism to 9th-12th graders for many years.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I researched and wrote this book during the summer and fall of 2015, the world often felt like a scary and sad place,&#8221; Schatz shares in a personal note from the writer at the end of the book. &#8220;News of war, terrorism, gun violence, and human suffering was relentless. Far away in lands distant from my own, people fled war, desperate to find new homes; here on the streets of America, police gunned down young black boys. Politicians and terrorists stoked hatred. Bullets flew, and tears fell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is no exaggeration to say that writing this book was a refuge for me. A reminder of the vast realities of historical suffering, and the enormous capacity for love and change. Every day I sought solace in the stories of these women whose lives were tragic and triumphant, inspiring and encouraging. When the forces of evil seemed to dominate the events of the world, these accounts reminded me that women have overcome, fought back, led, created, invented, achieved, and succeeded. We have climbed mountains, planted trees, crossed continents. We have protected land and language. We have been there. And always will be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a famous saying that &#8216;history is written by the victors,&#8217;&#8221; Schatz concludes. &#8220;I agree, but I&#8217;d also say that history is written by the writers&#8212;and I am one. And that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve made you this book.&#8221;</p></article-text><comments/><show-updated/><admin><audience/><admin/></admin><related-links><page><path>/</path></page><symlink><path>/</path></symlink><url>http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/03/alumna-rad-women.html</url><title>UC Santa Cruz alum writes first children’s book in City Lights’ 60-year history</title></related-links><profile-content><thumb><path>/</path></thumb><thumb-alt/><title></title><description/></profile-content><events><end-date/></events></system-data-structure></system-page><system-page id="f58b3f818072701752a34ca3d7554d10"><name>staff-town-hall</name><is-published>true</is-published><last-published-on>1672879663664</last-published-on><last-published-by>ttran34</last-published-by><title>You're invited!
